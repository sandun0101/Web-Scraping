Chiquita H.,"I could not ask for a more punctual, diligent, going above, and beyond what was provided by Kyle. He mount it to televisions and assembled a desk. One of the televisions was the picture frame television, and the other was mounted on a swivel. The desk, one of those that can be raised or lowered to a comfortable working position. 100% will use his services again. Thank you, Kyle.

Shari t.,"My TV was mounted on the wall within an hour. I had originally purchased a mount, which didn't work with my TV. The technician had another one with him, which saved me time and money."
Heather M.,We needed our living room TV professionally hung so that the wires were hidden and so I’d be able to utilize more of my mantle. Kyle was super prompt in responding to my first inquiry and so professional and timely when it came time for our appointment. He did a great job and even made our dogs feel loved! Definitely would work with him again.

Heeral P.,"Kyle was such a great hire. We have always mounted TVs ourselves in the past, but with a bigger TV this time and busier schedules, we wanted to hire someone. Kyle gave us a great deal and was even able to put up our TV within an hour of posting our need. He was extremely professional, wore booties over his shoes, was able to work with 2 crazy kids running around, and was quick to think of solutions whenever we hit a snafu. We plan to hire him again for another TV we need to mount. Just hire him!

Nicole J.,"I needed floating shelves and a mirror hung up in my home. Weekends are the only time I truly can focus on home projects. I searched on thumbtack for assistance with this project and came across Kyle (Harford Handy). I immediately sent a message and immediately got feedback. His schedule was pretty full but he was able to accommodate same day and was right on time for our scheduled appt. 

It was a quick job overall but he took his time to make sure I was happy with the end results. I would highly recommend him. We look forward to hiring him in the future for other home projects.
