siderite,"Imagine a video game where you are shooting bad guys. Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.

That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4. The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense. Not even the tongue-in-cheek references to The Matrix don't hit, because you know that if you enjoyed that film, you're now over 40 and it makes you feel old. The film is three hours of irrelevance.

And if you are among the people who I can't understand that rated this film anything above boring, just watch the end credits scene. It destroys the little joy that you might have kept watching this.

Bottom line: So many talented people worked on this film. With them on board, I cannot imagine a worse outcome. It's not even funny, it's just sad.",4
neil-476,"The Table, the international crminal brotherhood which has condemned John Wick empowers The Marquis to deal with him (and the Manager of the New York Continentale Hotel). But maybe, just maybe, there is a way out.

As expected, the IMDB is full of people saluting this as ""Best John Wick yet,"" ""A masterpiece,"" ""Best action movie ever,"" etc. My view differs. But I must start by giving credit where it is due. Production design, cinematography, action choreography and direction are all first rate, and they deserved a much better film that this is. And this film deserved a much better script than this.

The story is fine, quite good even, but it is buried under industrial quantities of action which defies belief. Everbody's resistance to trauma and the complete absence of police are just the big two, but let's not forget the endless succession of pairs of heavies coming out of nowhere and only stopping when Wick has no gun.

And even the scriot deserved a better actor than Keanu Reeves. To be fair, the character in the first film has been reduced to a mere cardboard cutout here, but Reeves (who I genuinely like as a performer) doesn't even play cardboard well here.

This is beautifully crafted drivel. 7 for craft, 3 for Reeves' central performance, averages to 5.",5
namob-43673,"These John Wick movies can be sort of fun in the sense that they are unintelligent violent nonsense pretending to be movies. There is something entertaining about dumb nonsense sometimes, and the first two of this franchise was decently okay in this regard. The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb.

This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute. Because if you have seen the previous instalments you have seen this one to. This is like a bad video game repeating the same thing, the same course, the same enemies, and for the 4th time. There is also a post credit scene, which is simply dumb, no reason to stil around for it.

The acting is also horrid, and if you are going to buy any of this you have to have good acting but no.

The only positive I can say about this movie is that it is not as putrified as many other movies lately so for a contemporary action movie this is not as bad as much else.

I give this a very, very generous 3/10. If you want to watch this, don't. Go watch the first one, and maybe the second one instead. Those are also highly stupid, but at least decently entertaining, this is not.",3
BA_Harrison,"The first three John Wick films came in fairly quick succession, with only five years between the first and third chapters, each film trying to top the one before in terms of wild set pieces. For me, it all became a bit too much, the action rapidly becoming too frenetic and over-the-top. By Parabellum (part three), I had had enough.

I hoped that the four years between Parabellum and this fourth entry in the franchise had given me a big enough breather that I might be able to find new appreciation for the excessive mayhem. If anything, I found Chapter 4 even more tiresome: the fight scenes, as technically excellent as they are, simply don't know when to quit, and they're even more ridiculous than ever. Wick has been established as a semi-mythical being (Baba Yaga), seemingly impervious to pain and injury, meaning that the character is never in any real peril, which generates zero jeopardy or excitement. If anything, the relentless action scenes result in boredom, being mind-numbingly repetitive and far-fetched (the whopping 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't help).

Director Chad Stahelski pushes plausibility way beyond breaking point with a protracted melee amidst the traffic around the Arc De Triomphe that somehow fails to attract the attention of the Paris gendarmerie; an even more dumb scene (in a film packed with dumb scenes) sees nightclub revellers continuing to dance while people are being shot and axed to death all around them. The final act - a duel between John and blind warrior Caine (Donnie Yen) - takes place outside the Basilica of Sacr√©-Coeur de Montmartre at dawn, with not a single tourist or passerby to alert the authorities of what is occurring.

I've been known to enjoy comic-book action films that aren't exactly grounded in reality, but John Wick 4 seems to take place in an alternate universe where none of our rules apply. Since very little of what we see in this film can be believed, I definitely don't swallow the idea that John Wick is actually dead at the end (although I sincerely hope he is).

Those claiming that this is the best action film ever made have clearly never seen The Raid 2 (or any early John Woo film, or The Night Comes For Us, or Ong-Bak, or Born To Fight, or Eastern Condors or In The Line of Duty IV or.... well, you get the idea).",4
skyhawk747,"What is all the raving about with this movie? I felt it lacked a decent storyline and was 2 hours and 35 mins of fighting while the remaining 10 or so minutes was acting.

The usual far too long fighting scenes where he does his usual MMA moves by getting the enemies head between his legs while he reloads his gun and shoots him the head.

For me it was at least an hour too long and could have been much shorter. The storyline was very weak and after such a long gap between this and John Wick 3 I am surprised it was written better.

I also have no idea why this review has to be a minimum go 600 characters?

Yes we.",4
FeastMode,"Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.

I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.

There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).

The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.

There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.

Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.

About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.

The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.

Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.

EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.

It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this. Updating rating from 8 to 9 stars.

fciocca,"I went to the cinema with great expectations. I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. ""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.",4
dstan-71445,"Very much over rated. Repetitive, tiring and inauthentic fight choreography for 3 hrs straight. Unnatural and generic one liner filled script. No deep drama whatsoever. Just bland, perpetual killings till one is numb. Awful and fake seeming blood effects. Bland, cliched action hero.

All these characterize John Wick 4. These movies keep getting shallower with every sequel. The little soul the first two had is dead and buried here. I don't get the hype. John Wick has become like those generic, action B movies with cliched scripts and characters. Not to forget the unlikable and uncharismatic addition, black guy with a dog. He was as dull as it gets.

Beautiful cinematography though. Loved some of the scenes except the CGI ones. A point for that I guess.",2
antti-eskelinen-329-929792,"In my opinion this is by far the worst movie of the franchise. It's just way too over the top. Everybody seems to have magical jackets now to stop the bullets.

Audience loved the dogs on the third one so that just lazily copied one here also but didn't bother to have any real cool scenes with it.

I'm happy they made John Wick 1 but since then every movie getting worse and worse. This one was already so bad that I regret spending any money to see it.

People shooting and dying in center of Paris but police doesn't seem to care.

John Wick getting shot, falling from great heights etc without any issues.",4
lovemichaeljordan,"Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.

The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.

I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it! Why watch a computer-generated ""superhero"" fly around when you can witness Reeves and Yen engage in a genuine and thrilling fight?",8
markvanwasbeek,"By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.",9
kskmah,"Who needs a 2hr and 40 min action movie? No one. Yes the action was good, but repeats so many times that it becomes so boring. How can hundreds of assassins not kill one man? Answer, not possible, only in this movie and series. How many times could the dog man have killed Wick? Many. So no other assassin could? Why would the table head get Caine to kill Wick when he knows he won't. You can challenge the head to a duel as a rule, but they only assigned a head for the first time ever in this movie? WTF? And then the head can select a replacement? And he selects a blind man. All Wick had to do was to stand on the side or drop down and he wouldn't get shot. I think everyone knew Wick didn't shoot in the last round, except for the stupid head bad guy. This is not an action movie, it's a fantasy.",1
IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews,"In this fourth installment of 8711's successful franchise, Keanu Reeves wearily drags himself from setpiece to setpiece, saying little, surviving the most ridiculous setups and finally achieves nothing.

The acting and writing of JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 are indeed the worst aspects of this film, and the exaggerated runtime of almost three hours doesn't help.

Try to remember John Wick's motivation to do all the things he does. What exactly is he actually doing, escpecially in this one? In addition to a lack of motivation, Chapter 4 is a remarkable retcon in the sense that John Wick could have ended the hunt for his person way earlier, thus making at least the last two installments redundant.

There's plenty of action here, sure, but it has been getting more and more unrealistic, and so you'll be in a situation where your suspension of disbelief says bye-bye, especially when you contrast the growing ridiculousness of the action with John Wick's decreasing vigour.

The plot has some toddler level plot holes and contrivances which are really distracting, yes, even in an action no-brainer like this. Keanu Reeves has maybe ten lines of dialogue in the whole movie. The Marquis is a nonsense character, just like Donnie Yen's Caine character. They just appear, but especially in Caine's case you're supposed to be emotional about it because he's basically John Wick's brother from another mother. We just never knew about him. Oh well.

This is the definition of a dumb movie for dumb people, and if you just want to enjoy some nice shots and over-the-top action (some of which is really nice) AND love Keanu Reeves, this is your jam. If you need a bare minimum of consistency and structure, you might feel cheated.",5
rupali-38827,"No idea how the ratings are as high as they are. If you thought the first one was enjoyable but the 3rd one was bull, read on.

Just as the body count in the 3rd was ridiculous, this is even more absurd. Seems after coming up with the bullet proof suit the writers etc thought it a good idea to make sure everyone has one. These giant men sent to kill Wick all wearing suits, raising the jacket to protect their heads was a sight I found so funny. He's the best hitman on the world, how do we kill him? I know, we'll send a blind man!! Pathetic. And he can dodge bullets and he knows where everyone is. You could say it looked choreographed.

Now, about the DJ! They may have well cut the scenes directly from the Warriors. Better film, done better and that isn't a great film. For those of you who have never heard of the Warriors, go watch it. For those of you that have, skip this nonsense.",4
cadillac20,"Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.

John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.

Covering four continents, we get fights on a massive set of stairs, fights in the middle of traffic, at one of the coolest looking hotels ever shown on screen, and so on. The fighting, of course, is exceptional, and it brings nunchakus, dogs, throwing stars, swords, guns, and so much more. It's everything a John Wick fan could want and, because these films are so technically proficient, you never feel like you're missing any of the action. Possibly the most creative choice is my favorite scene, one that combines a visually fantastic weapon with a shot choice that is unusual for action films of this nature, but the combination of these two pushes the scene into maybe one of action film's greatest scenes.

Admittedly, the story does leave a bit to be desired, but the minor complaints about these kinds of things pale in comparison to what we get. Hollywood has a new film to hold itself to and I have a feeling that (at least for me) action filmmaking will be judged by the standard this movie sets. It's such a blast, I already want to see it again.",10
tresm87,"Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.

One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.

Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.

The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.

Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.",9
MovieIQTest,"From the very beginning to the end, nothing but endless kills, fighting, close combats, bloods squirts or splashes, KR after four chapters, he looked older, slower and tiresome. The screenplay was so pretentious and pointless, the dialog looked forced and boring, katana swords vs. Bullets, and almost every bullet could be fenced off by the katana sword blades. The scenarios and the plots just kept stacked up without any reason or clue, just kill, kill, kill...nothing but kills. All the fighting sequences just like Shaw Brothers' 1970s poor and laughable Hong Kong martial art movies, heavily choreographically staged, looked so forced and fake. Every kill was not killed with one bullets but many, yet the handguns seemed equipped with endless bullets, bang, bang, bang, even the fallen guys already dead, but still needed to be shot several times more to increase the violent sound effect. I don't know what's the purpose of making these 4th Chapter, and I think the 1st Chapter only needed a following 2nd Chapter to end it, but what the heck, brainless young viewers need bloody fights, more dead bodies, ridiculous screenplay with clueless storyline, no real plots or real story really needed, just created something like violent video games.

When John Wick fought for his life in the Japanese hotel against so many clueless foes and the Zatoishi-like blind swordsman played by Donny Yen with a Botox injected face, we all decided to quit at the same time.

Hey, it's time to wrap it up, guys, no sense to continue to Chapter 5!",N/A
IWasKnownAsThe1SentenceReviewer,"I thought I remembered a less caricatural Keanu Reeves (""Yeaaah..."", ""I'll stay..."") and a more Nobody (2021)-like franchise but JW:C4 really felt like a bad ""kingsman"" mixed with an equally lousy Hotel Artemis (2018).

And why the sempiternal clich√© of the Black supporting character, playing the janitor what's more, and being the first ""good guy"" to die for absolutely no reason?

Ok, let's review the clich√©s, then:

Cultural misrepresentation? Soo clich√©...
Characters? Sooo clich√©...",1
Phil_H,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is almost three hours of Keanu Reeves engaged in a gunfight, bookended with meaningless dialog-in-place-of-plot, and a lot of people being thrown down stairs. Of all the ""Wick"" movies, this is clearly the weakest one yet. Was anything added to the overall Wick-universe narrative? No. Did we see a whole lot of inconsequential people die? Yes. Did Keanu Reeves say ""yeah"" a lot? Yes.

Look, I was hoping for SO much more than this. A meaningful ending to the series (which it isn't, because apparently this made so much money they are working on a fifth film), but what we got here was something in very much need of more script doctoring and less ""bang-bang.""

With a little more work, this could have been an average movie. Don't talk to me about stunts or cinematography or the choreography of the actors in-play, wow me with a plot that makes sense and moves the story forward--John Wick 4 does not move the story forward. It just says ""let's shoot a bunch of people, okay?"" And that's what it does... for 3 hours.

In the end I was of the following opinion once the credits rolled: ...and?...

We all deserved better than this. John Wick did, too.",4
tkdlifemagazine,"John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.

The film opens in New York City, the home of the notorious Continental Hotel, and takes us to Osaka Japan, Paris France, and Berlin Germany. Each of those cities plays a major role in Reeves' quest to seek revenge against the High Table for the acts outlined in the prior films, and to seek his unconditional freedom from service to their order.

As the story unfolds we learn a bit more about Wick's past and upbringing than we did in the prior films, but not enough to get bogged down in. He uses his connections to his past, and the help of some old friends to find a path to level the playing field with the High Table's Emissary, The Marquis, played masterfully by Bill Skarsg√•rd. Skarsg√•rd makes the character memorable, and unique, with just a hint of Santino from the second installment.

Keanu Reeves as John Wick in John Wick 4. Photo Credit: Murray Close Hiroyuki Sanada and Reeves are reunited, having starred in 47 Ronin together. Sanada, as is always the case, is a strong presence in the film and makes the most of every scene he is in. He is a great addition to the film. The Osaka Continental fight scenes are groundbreaking, and among the best and most exciting in the entire series. This is some of the best fight and action choreography you will see; only topped by other scenes in this same movie.

Scott Adkins plays an unusually larger than life villain adeptly. The action and violence around the Berlin scenes involving his character, and his relationship to Reeves' past is fun to watch. Adkins is great to watch, whether starring in his own projects, or supporting, as he is here.

Shamier Anderson and Clancy Brown are new to the series and add great value. Anderson as a cunning assassin conflicted between admiration and greed. Clancy Brown is a strong presence and welcome replacement in the role of Adjudicator. I found Asia Kate Dillon's version of the same character to be the weakest part of the prior film, and, perhaps, of the whole series.

Mark Zaror, another great martial artist also has a prominent role as The Marquis' right hand man.

Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne return and offer more than just familiarity to the cast. Their roles are significant and meaningful.

Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.

Keanu Reeves continues to be engaging, empathetic, and dynamic in the role of John Wick. While the series has strayed a bit from the deeply reluctant anti-hero of the first film; we continue to cheer for the good guy caught up in a bad, bad world. One of the great strengths of the film is that Reeves and Stahelski are not afraid the let characters other than Wick shine. In fact, all of the stars of this one have their deeply profound and memorable moments in and out of the company of the main character. This really works.

As for the fight and action choreography. The stunt team at 87eleven continue to elevate the game. The film has three major, larger than life action sequences, that each, individually, outdo anything you will see in any other non John Wick movie. As mentioned previously, the Osaka and Berlin scenes were high energy, high body count affairs. They were complete with gun fights, sword mastery, gun play, and one of the best nunchuck displays you will ever see outside of a Bruce Lee movie. As for the scenes in Paris, at the Arc De Tripomphe, and on the Church steps, they are unlikely to be forgotten and, unlikely, to be topped for years to come, if ever. They are unique and exciting and violent feasts for the eyes.

While I have heard some say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best installment in the series I have to disagree, Nothing can top the original, in my opinion; however, Chapter 4 is a worthy installment for sure.

Will there be a Chapter 5 to the JohnWick saga? Remember, I said this was a Spoiler free review....

John Wick: Chapter 4 earns a 5 out of 5 star rating. It is worth seeing, and probably seeing again. I predict a significant box office gross for this one, and it is well deserved.",9
bienkow78,So the second and 3rd john wick movies were blazing electric movies that took john wick to unbelievable levels. This 4th wick movie was water down and embaressingly woke with a corney addition to the wick roster of assasins. Kane somewhat saved the movie at times but the movie felt vague and amibiguous with endless fighting and wayy over the top action the that took wick to a level of absurdity and crossed over to ridiculous and clever or as cool as part 3. Thr crafty skills wernt on display in the same they were in the last 3 movie outside of one glorious overhead camera shot of wick blistering through a apartment building. This scene alone bumped this film up into the above average relm.,3
navendu_krishnan,"Unpopular Opinion - John Wick 4 is a below average movie.

I loved all 3 John wick movies, but this one is more likely a conclusion of John wick series, So the fight scenes are boring and repetitive. Previous movies had different types of action and stunt choreographies. This one has long same fights , might be in different locations.

As far Keanu goes, his close up shots or his face doesnt appear in the movie atleast for a half time. John wick past movies had few dialogues but it had an impact, 4 has same few dialogues but it was very plain and flat.

Ending is Spoiler - John Wick Dies (or not) shown in a way that if there is a possibility of a sequel , there can be.

May stunts shots and its accuracy is totally gone, we can clearly see that where the gun is aimed and it just went like a paper plane. Even with the so-called Coat Armour, some pistol shots were directly aimed at Head / Leg which was again repelled with the armor which is in the shoulder.

The sad thing is this is the same with Balayya movies, but when it directed and taken in Hollywood people go crazy!

An average movie 6/10.",6
doc1150,"I don't get why this movie has a high score, it doesn't deserve it. It's horrible, it doesn't make any sense, just killing people, but how can it be possible that those people after being shot many times, were able to fight as nothing happened to them? And the plot? Trying to kill John Wick in any way possible, period.

The worst thing is that they used some scenes from the movie The Warriors (1979), they didn't try to change anything, a black woman with nice big lips, talking on the radio, guiding the gangs with the purpose to chase and kill The Warriors. Same with John Wick, but of course with a modern technology. Shame on you! Didn't you have any better idea? You just copied an old movie that was much better than this one, and that soundtrack was great!

What a disappointment! It remembers somehow Kill Bill, but that movie was very good, this one is almost unacceptable!

I enjoyed the other movies about John Wick, they were very well done, and had a good plot. This time it seems like they didn't know what to write.

Not even the ending was good, is he really dead? We can't be sure, and probably there will be a John Wick 5, because something is missing. Anyway the fight against the thugs, before the last duel, was really bad... just a videogame.",4
drjgardner,"...all at the same time. This hybrid comic book-video game has a stupid plot, worse than average acting, and fight scenes that are so poorly done you don't mind going to the bathroom. Don't get me wrong. I loved John Wick 1. Thought #2 was OK. Then came #3., It showed they were out of imagination and should have stopped with #2. Now with #4 they show that they are not artists or creatives but merely clowns looking for as buck.

It's not completely without value, which is why it got a 2 instead of a 1. The photography is beautiful and they have a dog as a hero. The rest is worthless. Save the money and the time.",2
vengeance20,"Ok, so I got back from seeing this entry yesterday night. I'm writing this review in the early hours after midnight as the film went on for a good whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes!! But we'll get to that in a bit...! Anyway, I was looking forward to this film since John Wick 3's release back in 2019 & this film has had a bit of a troubled history of getting pushed back until it finally got its March 2023 release. I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but, was looking forward to this as the John Wick films are ace, but this film was a bitter disappointment...!

The film sees John Wick, who from the events of the last film, has a price on his head which is increasing more than ever. The lethal unstoppable force of nature assassin now must fight against the High Table Global as he seeks out & fights the most deadly assassins players of the underworld from Paris to New York to Berlin to Japan. Will John Wick finally meet his match!?

Whoa...! Where do I start!? I found the film for starters to be too long!! At a whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes this film is way, way, way too long! The pacing... whoa! Don't get me started! I was willing to be tolerant & forgive the pacing, but when it got to the final leg it took the absolute puss & started to test my nerves! The story is so weak I had to look this film up in order to get what the plot was, again, another sign that the film was going to be bad, the first was the runtime, which I knew was going to be bad from the word go!

The film took a while to get going which was a pain, but it got there I guess! The fights were good, as with the John Wick films typically are, not to mention funny & brutal! But all things considered, it got repetitive fast & annoying especially near the end as I just mentioned! The story scenes were alright as with the villains & bad guys though again, it got repetitive & irritating.

The realism was stretch beyond its limits here in this film. John Wick fell from a great height on a metal pipe which looked to have (& lets be honest here) would've snapped his back like a tooth pick! John got hit by a car 5 times yet never suffers any bad injuries or dies! Yet a few bullet wounds finally kill him at the end (another downer of this film which I'll touch up on in a second!), the fight scenes in the night club where only a few people stood there shocked while about 95% just kept on dancing! Face palm! There were several other scenes which made you just think ""dafuq!?""

The lead up to the end was annoying! Just when you thought John Wick was going to go to the Stand Off with the blind villain, there was more fight scenes! Don't get me wrong, these fights where good, but annoying & held the film up for a good 20 minutes before the finale which to say the least, was anti climatic! The scene on the 122 steps was irritating & made you just scoffs in frustration when John got kicked down those steps which for a couple of seconds in its self, dragged & felt & looked comical! It's like getting so far in a mission in Grand Theft Auto V then dying & reverting back to the latest checkpoint where you have to start all, over, again!! The same feelings of that (from experience) where felt for me in this film from that scene!

Then of course, after John Wick killing 180 odd people (or more, I lost count obviously) he finally dies! What!? Like James Bond in that god awful Bond Film of 2021 No Time To Die!? Can't be!? What a poor show! Anyhow, to give you guys some perspective on how long this is in comparison to the rest of the films in the franchise! Without credits as they don't count!

John Wick (2015) - 1 hour 30 minutes John Wick 2 (2017) - 1 hour 50 minutes John Wick 3 (2019) - 1 hours 57 minutes John Wick 4 (2023) - 2 hours 39 minutes

Notice how the films got long & long with each entry...!

Overall, this ranks as they absolute worst of the franchise! I was willing to forgive the poor pacing & overly bloated runtime, but it got on my nerves too much to bare & when I saw that John Wick died!? Nope, that was it for me! The editing was poor with this film whoever edited this needs class in editing as this was bad beyond belief! The pacing also was poor combined with the bad editing! The fights were good, but too drawn out, long & annoyingly repetitive! The ending was both bad & anti climatic! How this film has 95% on RT is beyond me! But then what do I expect...! This ranks as the worst John Wick film in the franchise! With word of a female spin-off coming out (which will be bad), I've lost hope in this franchise! Let's hope John Wick 5 (if ever) redeems this kak entry!

4/10 & that's generous considering!",4
furnacefuneral,"Indiana jones, terminator, predator, Jurassic park, the matrix, Jason bourne, etc. All amazing franchises but all share a common trait of having a bad or forgettable movie or 2 at some point. This is why john wick is the best action action movie franchise of all time; The movies just keep getting better and better. In john wick 4, when the action starts in Osaka Japan, it never let's up despite it's almost 3 hour running time. What I really enjoyed the most about JW4 is the cast of characters. Great villains and allies really keep this movie interesting as john trots the globe for 3 hours. The sound engineering, editing, direction, cinematography are excellent as always. The color schemes throughout this franchise (more john wick 2, 3 and especially 4) are such a treat for the eyeballs. Best action franchise EVER. And the shotgun fight in Paris with the ""dragons breath"" is the best action sequence I've probably ever seen in my life.",10
UniqueParticle,"May or may not count as a spoiler but John Wick pilled up more of a body count than Jason Vorhees sure different genre yet both great killing machines! Chad Staleski created such a great action extravaganza quad of films and one of my favorite trivia's he was the stunt doable for Keanu Reeves in the The Matrix back in the day; fast forward to 2014 they work together on one of the greatest action films of our generation. John Wick 4 is ultimate experience that is a must see I can't praise enough for how much fun it is.

I might get vibes for my thoughts I tried not to spoil it's obvious the combination of kill count has added up the rest left to the viewers, the action and writing is incredible for Chapter 4 that everyone involved deserves praise! I'd like to say too I own all the John Wick films and every Matrix, I'll get this in 4K when available.",10
codytheway,"Listen, this movie was far from as good as the others and had very little realism to it compared to the others. Numerous times John falls from like 4 stories up and gets up and walks it off. He also gets hit by cars numerous times and simply just walks it off. He also falls down 222 steps and gets up and walks it off. Where is the realism here?

Also, the acting was incredibly bad. Like really really bad. Laurence Fishborne going over the top and Keanu not saying much, but when he does he makes himself sound like he's having a stroke.

Adding the black assassin dude simply as the diversity hire was a weird choice. Like seriously, he was the only black dude. The dude was a complete wild card that you had no idea whose side he was on. He was trying to kill John, but also trying to save him? Also, he had a dog to help him. Didn't Halle Berry have the exact same gimmick in the last movie that did the same trick of going for the nuts?

And where was John's motivation for all of this? Why was he in Japan? Why did he kill the High Table person? Why wasn't this Marques person introduced sooner? Why was a blind assassin 20x better than any of the other assassins? And lastly, why did John go through allllll of that crap just to die at the end? To protect Winston? The dude who shot him off roof?

Overall, there was only a couple of good parts to the movie. Nothing that the other 3 movies hadn't done before.",4
solidabs,"HORRIBLE movie. I love John Wick. I mean I wouldn't pay to see one, but I love the series none the less. Even liked the third one even though the ending blew baby chunks. All the 10s and 9s scores are so damn fake it's hilarious. IMDB is a joke. Someone needs to start a real movie database and weed out the fake high scores, it's as ridiculous as John Wick 4. He walks away from every major injury or collision or building fall. Then he passes away from flesh wounds. What nonsense. The whole plot is nonsense. The fights scene are so boring. I got up to make a sandwich twice. Just the typical 100 judo throws and same shots to head. Numerous coup de grace's. I feel sorry for anyone who paid for this nonsense.",1
Bibiliography,"This is laughably bad. My second hand embarrassment threw up its hands and died of shame.

I adore Keanu but my god he failed at even the most basic fight choreography; although the fault is shared equally with the script writers, the editing team, and the director who all decided we needed almost 3 hours of whatever this was.

If anyone believes that a half bent over John Wick could kill 100s of super trained assassins all by himself, then have I got a bridge to sell you in Laos.

Look, KR is like a 100 yrs old and should have long retired from doing any film that requires hand-to-hand combat.

Note to Keanu's agent: get this man into a zombie/apocalypse movie, ffs.",2
jtindahouse,"In a world where movie sequels seem to be loathed even before they are released, the 'John Wick' series has remained remarkably consistent and well received. In fact all three of the first films have the same IMDb rating of 7.4/10 and I noticed recently that I gave them all the same rating of 8/10. Incredibly, I think 'John Wick: Chapter 4' is the best the series has to offer. This movie was a wild ride.

I was a little disappointed when I first saw the runtime for this one was going to be almost 3 hours. I find that is becoming a tough runtime for a lot of films to justify. This film does it with no trouble. The pacing is so incredibly fast that the 3 hours pass by in no time. I remember looking down at my watch early in the film thinking maybe 20-25 minutes had gone by and almost an hour had already passed.

A large reason for this is the action sequences. When an action sequence starts in this film buckle in, because it is going to go for nearly 20-30 minutes and be non-stop craziness the for the duration.

The action sequences in this film are perfectly shot as they always are in this series. Lovely, wide camera angles so we can see every thing that happens and know that it isn't all being edited to look this way. These people are actually doing these things.

As always with these films you need to go in a rather incredible suspension of belief. Wick is nearing super-human level at this point. It doesn't matter how many cars you hit him with or how high the building he falls off is, he'll be back and fighting again 10 seconds later. It's best to switch your brain off at these points I have found.

Finally, I loved the main villain in this movie played excellently by Bill Skarsg√•rd. He was everything a villain should be. Calm and seemingly in control, menacing and easy for the audience to hate and root against.

This film was a blast from start to finish. 9/10.",9
george.schmidt,"JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 (2023) ***1/2 Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, Clancy Brown, Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, Aimee Kwan, Hiroyuki Sanada, Shamier Anderson, Rina Sawayama. Reeves' indestructible titular assassin returns in full form in the latest (and arguably best) of the fast-hitting, brutally violent action franchise with the marker on his head increased by new foe Skarsgard (oily good at being the villain) and the countdown to his demise imminent worldwide. The set pieces are displayed with cunning skill and scary accuracy with pressure point precision and unnerving balletic grace. A *chef's kiss* for the wherewithal overall and a genre fan's wet dream fulfilled. It kills! (Dir: Chad Stahelski)",9
statuskuo,"Sitting through the nearly 3 hours of this opus, I can't say that I didn't get my money's worth. But the ride was so bombastic, dark and mumbly that at a certain point it was like being stuck on a roller coaster ride that I've gone through 10 times and gradually sunk deeper and deeper into my chair.

What is this movie about? Long were the days of the original John Wick, where it felt nicely paced. A short film extended into a feature but still retained an independent film vibe. Those days are gone. When the original Wick came out, they kept it simple...man seeks revenge on some punks who killed his dog given to him from dead wife. That plot alone is laughably simple. Yet it worked. Perhaps it was the zeitgeist at the time. But this series falls into the VERY same trap they all do. Bigger everything. And that wasn't the case. The Table is a mysterious group that had slick lingo with caricatures of other movies that made you feel something familiar. The call center with its tattoo'd Betties seemed so out of a Jean Pierre Jeunet film like ""City Of Lost Children"" It was unique in the sense that it embraced its steam punk comic book feel. Then it imploded into ridiculous feats of inhuman strength. And a total lack of logic. Police apparently don't exist in John Wick Paris. Ugh.

Also, the stunts are great but after (I would calculate) an hour of the same aerobatics, leg locks, tosses and gun shot to head, I grew tired. Made me want to scream to move on. Yes, it has a visceral release to a general audience (I heard a few in my theater clap with approval. But also consider there was one mentally challenged one in a wheel-chair, the other was an elderly lady who was talking through the movie). The original Wick made you really feel the pain of its villains. And made it satisfying. Here, when he goes room to room sweeping with a fire launching shotgun, I wanted to REALLY cheer. It felt flat. Well done, but something was missing. That's what this entire movie felt like. Something missing. Keanu is obviously an expert gun handler now and does hand to hand combat well, but man was it getting old fast.

Bill Skarsgard, as the villain, seems to be tapping into Rami Malek from ""No Time To Die"" He's a meglamaniac whose ties to this under ground assassin league is anchored to funding it. Did they ever explain why this society even exists? Probably not. I was bored. Also, Ian MacShane's Manager role is exhaustively pedestrian.. I mean, tiresome tropes come out of his mouth as if it were the first time hearing it.

Everyone is desperate to be cool in this flick. Finally, the Donnie Yen character. Okay, a LOT cannot be forgiven. He is dragged into wanting to kill Wick because of threats to his family. Yet, he kills everyone BUT Wick and yet gets to survive. Here's the problem. It telegraphed it when he would incapacitate the guys in the kitchen of the Osaka branch. Instead of violently kill them. That's how you can tell he wasn't going to be a bad dude.

Oof. They add an extra assassin who totes along a dog. That dog was getting on my nerves. And I love dogs. This dog seemed to be trained to sick men's privates. For some reason. After the 5th go at this gag, it was dead in the water.

This is a subpar entry into the series. Though they kill off Wick in this flick (yeah right) he see some future installment with say...the daughter of the Osaka branch who seemed to have projected a future conflict with Wick in the future.

This series will never end as long as simple minded audiences exists. All Sound And Fury Adds Up To Nothing.",4
mklarsen-51895,"We all walk into John Wick 4 with expectations of what we will see, standards we refuse to lower and excitement already creeping in. From the first second it engages you, no hesitation, no quarter. And it's only the beginning. I read somewhere that a reviewer had said that there wasn't a wasted moment in this film and I watched it questioning the validity. They weren't wrong. Each conversation has a purpose, each scene makes a point. From the gunfight samurai scene in Tokyo to the phosphorus gunfight shot from above in Paris, the action doesn't diminish. Normally a sequel is ""lesser"" but John Wick 4 simply builds onto the quadrilogy. It makes sense, it continues the story and the characters get all the more interesting.

I can tell you right now, if the phosphorus gunfight scene doesn't impress you (which it will), the Paris traffic carnage scene is brilliant. I can't say I have ever seen someone do full continuous 360 drifting in a muscle car either :D

I know Keanu said that Chad Stahelski and himself were taking a long break from the John Wick series but should we have seen the end, it ended on a note I feel we could live with. If they can find another story that will build onto the John Wick series then so be it but if not, I truly left the movie happy and felt it was done.

Don't leave until after the credits are done. Trust me, it's not finished.",10
radhrh,"Just how much cash can you get out of a cash cow? As the John Wick producers know that's plenty of dough but with each iteration the movies become ever more flabby and contrived. The Hollywood formula has been employed; copy a previous success adding ever more crash bang and wollop and of course stretching the whole thing out to a dreary 3 hour run time. But of course Hollywood misses the point, yet again. What made the original Wick movie interesting was the character's struggle to make a new life only to be dragged back into the criminal underworld. Granted it's an interesting and novel criminal underworld but now it's the world of John Wick which is the focus, not Wick himself. Time to call it a day.",3
vibhus-17780,"Delivers a best high octane action thriller from the franchise .

Pros - There was bit let down in JW3 , but they came back with a banger JW4 and delivered one of the best actions of all time . Stunt choreography , Camera work , editing and heart pumping BGMs were totally bonkers . There were many prolonged action sequences through out the movie , each of them never fails to deliver some thrill and adrenaline rush . Besides from action set pieces , JW4 well contributed in the world building and this whole tetralogy done a good job in World building & character establishments , I hope it will be well used in its upcoming spin off series and movies . Cast did great job , especially Keanu Reeves and Donie Yen were great .

Cons - Few silly logical mistakes that you can't ignore .

Overall , to the action lovers and John wick fans out there don't miss out to watch it on big screen . Must watch . Highly recommended .",9
brndck,"Sheez Louise these are getting awful. They know the audience wants to see a conclusion; but like Lucy holding the football, they'll keep yanking it away forever. They're trying so hard to keep upping the level, but the fights are just cliche now. The NPCs all swing so slow, hold their hands out for so long, Ian McShanes new teeth are horrendously white, I'm a huge fan of his but it's just unnatural. Almost like Rudy Giuliani. The Bug eyed dude from the remake of IT is awful as a Frenchman? Belgian? Whatever his accent is supposed to be, it's bad. Donnie Yen's blind swordsman is amusing but still cheesy. Nobody? Who is this dude and why is he even in this movie??? Was there some contract requirement that said ""we must have a dude with a dog in this film""??? Please just finish the series and stop making more. Oh wait they just announced JW 5 in pre-production.

Can I jade my 12 dollars back???

The only GOOD part was the throwback to Warriors, and even that just seemed bizarre and completely out of place.",3
Brandon_Walker_Robinson,"That lasted 169 minutes? I had no idea. The time just flew right by.

Chad Stahelski does not pull any punches (or engage the safety) at any time in this gun-fu epic. Combat scenes are not moments so much as they are entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography that everybody had to synchronize to was rather incredible, and they continue to find more ways to entertain us with kills, kill types, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, etc. I caught myself smiling for minutes on end several times while watching it.

Of course though, as I said, they really lean into it. I'm sure this has been true of previous films as well, but it is very apparent that John Wick should virtually die in every scene that he is in. Whether it is how he is attacked or how they fail to attack him at the right times, he goes at every foe like the bear in The Revenant with full adrenaline and no signs of slowing down no matter what he is hit by. And again, I think if you look hard enough you will find enemies who have clear shots and choose not to take them because of plot armor, but you can forgive it enough if you're rewarded with a longer take or overall longer action sequence. What I really loved was how many of these scenes took place at night with dazzlingly lit environments all around, and the music in every scene kicks as much *** as what you see on screen. I had pondered over why John Wick doesn't have a video game yet, but if they ever make one I have decided I'd like one of those top-down shooter games (similar to The Hong Kong Massacre, and if not maybe like the GTA:SA MP rampage style).

I acknowledge this franchise for what it is now, but I still pine for some of the missing components that I don't know if it'll ever be able to bring back. After watching John Wick, fun as it was, I found myself interested in seeing a prequel when he was the Baba Yaga in his prime, taking missions rather than being hunted. Even still, at least in that movie he was absolutely feared. In Chapter 2, I still found him heavily respected, but it was in that movie that I realized there would probably be a repetitive formula to the narrative and movie/action structure (which still has yet to break). In Chapter 3, there only lived assassins and they would go after him without hesitation, which did is not how I felt the world breathed the first time around. They continue down this path in Chapter 4, while opening the universe more to different characters breeding their own kind of loyalty. They are all insanely fun to watch, and you see the cogwheels of the John Wick universe spinning with the future Continental television show and the Ballerina movie spinoff. Where they remain faulty though is even with the existence of civilians during fight scenes, they act as droning NPC's like nothing is happening around them, or they aren't there whatsoever. It is clear that this is not our world that this movie takes place in, but rather a parallel one.

I mentioned the introduction of new characters in this world, and you can't not bring up Donnie Yen when talking about them. He steals each and every scene that he is in, and it's crazy because you wonder how a character like his could thrive in such a world but you absolutely believe it when you watch it. I will absolutely take more of him and Rina Sawayama. She isn't featured as much, but she makes use of every second that she is in front of the camera. There are plenty of others (such as the great Hiroyuki Sanada), but the point remains that Wick is relegated to this greater universe with characters who-good, bad, or for themselves-are ones we can actually root for in any fight. Keanu Reeves is understandably less nimble at his age than the others (and it's either bad acting or he really has taken on this John Wick role in his line delivery to hilarious new heights), but he and Stahelski have found a groove that still makes him the most impenetrable force around, to the point that I go back and watch the action scenes in The Matrix Resurrections and wonder what happened there. I didn't love one particular character in their big fighting moment(s), but they go for versatility and I have to give them that much.

March has had an incredible run of theatrical films, and John Wick: Chapter 4 is no different. You will lean forward during the action which there is plenty, and if I'm one to go off of you will not feel the runtime. There is an end credits scene as well if you're able to stay for a moment longer. I would love to go back and see this one again.",8
baant,"This was just like watching my nephew play a videogame for 3 hours straight. I normally like action movies, and don't mind the hole plots, the exaggerations ++ as long as you get involved with the characters and it's funny. This had little humor, and it was so over exaggerated the the point I just wanted everyone to die (even John, and he should have died 1,5 hours earlier). I was so mad when he fell down the stairs for the 20th time, I just wanted the movie to end. No fun to watch when the main characters supposedly have superpowers and could have won the WW2 all by them selves. But I guess people don't expect much from movies anymore.",1
imseeg,"The bad: it lasts too long. A whopping 2 hours and 45 minutes. Some of the fighting scenes stretch out over 5 to 15 minutes of CONTINEOUS fighting. But after having watched over 2 hours of fighting already, I definitely began to long for it to end.

The good: the fighting scenes are pretty good though. I was wondering if they could still come up with some new and interesting fighting choreography and they succeeded at that quite well. There are even quite a few comical fighting stunts included. Nice!

All in all not a bad sequel. If it werent for the much TOO long duration I would rate this nr 4 sequel better / higher as the nr 3 edition.

Nothing beats the original first edition of John Wick though, because THAT first edition was not only contineous action but also cared about the CHARACTERS. Unfortunately all the sequels were more and more focussed on solely the figthing scenes, which kinda bored me in the end.

Nr 4 is highly overrated. I suspect because of artificial ""managing"" of the Imdb ratings. This movie is never worthy of 8 stars (ridiculous). 6 stars at best. But because I got bored at the end I will only rate it 5 stars...",5
michaelquinn1966,"I'll preface this review by stating I loved the first three John Wick films especially the first one and was very much looking forward to number four.

The premise ""too much of a good thing, can be a bad thing"" very much applies to JW chapter 4. What a way to decimate a franchise. This latest instalment was three hours of the same fighting scenes redone time and time again only difference a new city, three hours of a nonsensical story that just made nonsense and was basically just recycling scenes from the first 3 films.

An hour or so into this film I was ready to quit, it was just mind numbingly boring and ridiculous

A Blind Assasin - who can't detect a person five feet in from of them but manages to defeat anyone who came his way Halle Berry looking really rough and minus a dog, what was the point of this character A $20 million open contract on John Wick, yet he moves around the world unhindered until they basically redo the first 15 mins of the third film but in Paris when all of a sudden they need yet more fighting scenes A ridiculous and pointless omage to ""The 1979 Warriors movie"". Broadcasting over radio to French gangsters and Assasins in English.............. wtf üò¨

I could go on and on with everything that was wrong with this film but let's get to the good points ............................. There isn't a single one, this is just a terrible, terrible film and would have been a horrible way to end the franchise if news of a fifth film entering production and I can only imagine how bad that is going to be.

So ignore all these high mark reviews as they are quite simply lying and watch this train wreck at your own peril.",2
Andrew_Wiper,Quite possibly the best action movie of the decade. It's only 2023. This one is currently number one. Terminator 2 is the best action movie of all time. The raid 2 is the best action sequel of all time. This movie is the best 4th movie in a series of all time. Props to lethal weapon 4 as well. Keanu is a bad ass ok. He moves a little slow in the beginning but by the time the second half comes along he moves like a martial arts madman. That being said.. the nunchucks he incorporates into his character in that first half is brilliant. The set pieces in this are absolutely fantastic. The music is perfectly incorporated as well. There were a few nods to some classic flicks too. Movie buffs will catch them.,10
Holt344,"My expectations for John Wick: Chapter 4 was high, these films have become some of my favorite action films of all time, and I can say this without giving it a second thought how it met those expectations. The thugs and easy obstacles are nothing new, except for how they too have ballistic suits like our protagonist. But this Chapter begins with a recovered Baba Yaga who's out for blood. Actors and returning characters along with Keanu Reeves as John Wick is Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Ian McShane as Winston Scott, and Lance Reddick (in one of his final roles) as Charon. New roles which I loved was Donnie Yen as Caine: a blind High Table assassin and an old friend of John Wick.

Bill Skarsg√•rd as the Marquis Vincent de Gramont: a powerful member of the High Table whose position is challenged by John Wick. Hiroyuki Sanada as Shimazu Koji: the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel and an old friend of John Wick. It also stars Shamier Anderson, Rina Sawayama and Scott Adkins.

The premise goes like this: John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes.

Let's dig deeper into the story and what sequences I liked the most, I have a weak spot for samurai movies and the Osaka Continental offers just that. Brilliant choreography for each character, good guys like bad guys. With Hiroyuki Sanada being as brilliant as ever! Also showing off Donnie Yen's retired blind assassin. It's always nice to see a new Continental and this one sure felt special, you notice what friendship John Wick and Shimazu Koji has. The action sequence was great! But my favorite city and action sequences are found in Paris, it has the biggest importance to the story, it brought so many memorable moments. It shows why Keanu Reeves was and is right to lead this franchise. Paris is also the city where Marquis Vincent de Gramont is located and he becomes the highest-ranking member of The High Table during this film. Bill Skarsg√•rd holds one of the strongest performances in the film as the Marquis. Keanu Reeves holds the best though, maybe not the best dramatic performance but certainly overall performance as he does his own stunts alongside everything else, and the stunts are incredible. Donnie Yen was great and possibly even one of the best things of the movie, both his knowledge in martial arts but also his character which I loved. The performance that surprised me was Shamier Anderson as the mysterious bounty hunter, it's a great character that they could do so much with and I can easily say the same for Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada's characters. One of the final action sequences was all in a one take, except for a quick cut before moving back to the one take. It was shot with a camera above, letting us see everything happening from above and moving with John Wick as he fires inside an abandoned building.

Chad Stahelski truly directed an action film that'll be remembered for decades, his direction in both the action and more dramatic scenes are all brilliant. There's so many fight sequences in this film, small like big, all directed and shot brilliantly. The screenplay was done by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch, I don't have any problem with it, it's good and for a Wick film it holds the same quality. The movies aren't about the best writing in Hollywood, it's about what happens on the screen, blood being spilled. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard returned to compose the score for the film, after doing so for the previous three films. Like Shay Hatten had done too.

I have read various of critics and some people complaining about the length, Chapter 4 has a runtime of 169-minutes. Its long, full of beautiful looking shots that does nothing to the story, only to create atmosphere and suspense where it succeeds. There are scenes that you could easily trim, yes, but I still found the length to be perfect. I want to see the 3 hour 49 minute version just because of how great the film was, but the theatrical version is magnificent. Chapter 4 is all about tying up loose ends, to finally find peace and freedom. It's a long road to that point, Chad uses the film's length for just that, to tell a bigger and deeper story than a simple story. More run time also means for more action sequences!

This might be the best film of the four, both action and drama, also most beautiful in regards of the camera work and cinematography. Dan Laustsen truly knows his craft, making each scene absolutely mesmerizing to look at! I loved every second of it, when I saw it at the cinema, a woman (a mother) sat beside the person I was there with and said how brutal it was... She was five minutes in and the first action scene had only just started. Jokes aside, John Wick: Chapter 4 has some of the franchise's best action sequences and Keanu Reeves at his best. Like his role in The Matrix, John ""Baba Yaga"" Wick will be another role he'll be remembered for. This was an incredible film, one of the best I've seen in awhile.",10
zameerpro,"John Wick series have always been over-the-top action / thriller joyrides more focused on dazzling you with visceral, expertly choreographed action sequences than trying to tell the most coherent stories about stylish assassins. Director Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 4 is no exception. And it abundantly delivers on the franchise's hallmarks - snazzy guns, lovable dogs, and one very haggard man in black. John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't a movie you casually sit down to watch apropos of nothing. It's a commitment, both in terms of how long it is and in how invested you really have to be in the idea of John Wick for the film to be engaging. To its credit, John Wick: Chapter 4 does an admirable job of leaving open possibilities for a future filled with stories of some of the movie's new supporting characters. It comes as a pleasant surprise given how much time this story spends trying to remind you that Wick is the baddest man in town. It's a movie that's meant to be watched loud and big. Remember ! John Wick has fought hard for it.",9
musicnetwork-85033,"John Wick 1 was the best imo. The story was somewhat coherent and drew attention. There was plenty of action that was exciting without being over-the-top ridiculous.

Next up in John Wick 2, the story was still somewhat coherent and though some scenes started to become a bit nonsensical(tons of assassins and no police etc), it was still a solid movie and easy to follow.

In John Wick 3 everything took a nosedive into utter nonsense. Part 4 expanded on this with nothing but lots of ridiculous wild nonstop fights. Typical Hollywood cash grabs devolved into absolute boring and ridiculous rubbish.",2
maximeracicot,"Right off the bat, the second scene where he is chasing three guys on a horse in the desert (why? Who are they?) and then kills The Elder who's just sitting there, with very little fanfare in the middle of nowhere, no protection or even servants, I was immediately underwhelmed. This is supposed to be like a big deal, yet it felt meaningless.

After that, it's just a bunch of barely credible fight scenes, over and over and over and over... All with convenient bulletproof clothing, and apparently none of these trained killers and thousands of bullets can hit the man's head. The cream of the crop is at the Arc de Triomphe, where he gets hit by four cars no less and just walks it off each time. Or where he jumps 4-5 stories high and slams his body basically head first on a parked car, and just walks that off too. Or when he falls down 222 stairs and walks THAT off.

In the end, this is all just a cheap video game, where your character goes from set piece to set piece and has to shoot his way out; but in God mode.

This thing is getting great reviews all over. What a low point we've come to.",5
danielbrown-47106,"First one was undeniably glorious in so many ways including being somewhat of a homage to the Neo we never got because sequels notoriously tend to fail dismally regardless of how good the first movie was, such was the case with Matrix and I'm sad to say, such is the case with John Wick too. JW2 was pretty good though, albeit ridiculous and farfetched.. 3 was ok, but felt like much of the same. Now just watching 4 I'm literally bored.. and I love martial arts, guns, tactical training and Japanese culture.. All this ""round table"" ho-ha is bonkers and Keanu as much as I love the guy is clearly slowing down a lot now whilst enemy's around him do that real obvious dance that makes them appear like they're attacking to the best of their ability but in reality they're just making movement and waiting their turn to be blitzed one by one. The filming style too feels overdone and old. Like watching Matrix now in 2023 and seeing the fight scenes look like something straight out of a WB studio drenched in PG infused unrealism, JW has suffered much the same fate.. although both the Matrix and JW were once mind blowing pieces of art, now they're both like stale bread..",3
jwhitey-43110,"The fight scenes were terrible. Looked absolutely fake. This movie series should stop. Turning into Fast and Furious. The people at times were waiting for Keanu to turn around before throwing the slowest fakest punches ever. The punches Keanu was throwing didn't look remotely real. The nunchucks scenes were crazy bad. This movie is not good.

It is so stupid that you have to write so much in order to leave a review. There is no need to write a paragraph in order to review a movie. Especially one as trash as John Wick 4.

Crazy people acting like this movie is good. By far the worst of the franchise.",6
kfilippopoulou,"Come on guys. Let's admit it.

It was bad. Really bad.

John should be dead countless times. Assassins who while holding a gun, trying to punch him instead of shooting? üí© in the first scene, the archers had everyone surrounded, and... Missed?

John being hit by a car like ten times, hard, and still walking. His opponents hit once by a car, lightly and stayed down.

Also... What was the "" Blade scene""... The whole "" the legend"" will smith vibe?

The... Neo / morpheus thing A quick the exorcist scene, and Lawrence of the Arabia scene... A big no for me... It didn't make any sense... Hell I could be a better opponent than the guys John faced...watched that for 2.30 hour for him just die in a duel? Lol...em... No.",1
Tactrix,"So I like the John Wick series as much as the next guy but this is just lazy. There are a couple of things that we need to address here.

First the story has gotten very VERY stale. Like to the point of where if you removed the story, it wouldn't have mattered, at all.

Second as where in the first movie there was some pretty damn good choreography, in this installment I literally watched MULTIPLE scenes of guys standing around waiting for 1 guy to go down so they could pretend to jump in. And no, this wasn't like a behind the scenes take.

And the final insult is the actual fighting itself, there are just times when for no reason the person he's fighting just sits there, they aren't knocked out, they aren't dead, they're just waiting for him to get his gun, load some bullets, go for a coffee, and then shoot them. It actually pains me to watch this garbage be pawned off as a top tier movie.

This is when you guys should stop this series, lets be honest you should have stopped it at the last movie, but ok, you had to give it a proper ending. News flash, this isn't it.",4
spammer-95827,"Repetitive Action, Lacks Story.

The movie has some great action seens but it's too repetitive and lacks reality completely. There's no story and the high table, just wants to keep giving John chances to be a free guy over and over again. Expected more from this movie tbh.

ChatGPT Title: ""John Wick 4: Explosive Action with a Repetitive Plot""

Word Count: 709

""John Wick 4"" is the highly anticipated sequel to the action-packed franchise that has captivated audiences with its adrenaline-fueled sequences. While the film delivers on its promise of spectacular action scenes, it falls short in terms of originality and narrative depth. Despite its flaws, ""John Wick 4"" manages to entertain fans of the series, but fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessors.

Undeniably, the movie showcases some truly impressive action sequences. From intense gunfights to jaw-dropping stunts, the film's choreography and execution are impeccable. The fight scenes are meticulously crafted, and Keanu Reeves once again proves his dedication to his role as the lethal assassin John Wick. The combination of Reeves' physicality and the expertly designed action sequences creates a thrilling cinematic experience that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.

However, the film's biggest flaw lies in its repetitiveness. While the previous installments of the franchise offered a fresh take on the action genre, ""John Wick 4"" feels like a rehash of familiar territory. The plot fails to bring anything new to the table, resulting in a sense of predictability that diminishes the overall impact of the film. The narrative lacks the complexity and depth that fans have come to expect from the series, leaving much to be desired.

One of the disappointments of ""John Wick 4"" is the lack of a compelling story. The film relies heavily on the established formula of John Wick facing insurmountable odds and battling countless adversaries. The absence of a coherent and engaging plot prevents the movie from reaching its full potential. While the franchise has never been known for its intricate storytelling, this installment takes it to a new level by prioritizing action over substance.

Another aspect that hampers the film's impact is the portrayal of the High Table. In previous movies, the enigmatic organization added an element of intrigue and mystery to the narrative. However, in ""John Wick 4,"" the High Table becomes a monotonous antagonist whose only purpose seems to be providing John Wick with repeated chances for redemption. This narrative choice not only diminishes the stakes but also makes the world feel less grounded and realistic.",1
hgraizen,"Other John Wick's films are acceptable, it needs some effort to be a believable character but still they are good and entertaining action movies, but... here comes the but.... John Wick 4 is totally non-sense, just a few things to expect: 1. JW suit appears to be a tank armor, if you forget any physics law and has no idea what a gun is, ok, otherwise even Rambo movies are more realistic.

2. The Table has all the best assassins in the world and a blind guy is able to kill everyone without being shot. Seriously?

3. Every enemy when hit once by a car dies, except for JW which is hit by I don't know, more than 20 cars and keep walking normally... hey, what? ""God-mode on"" 4. Hundreds of people shoot JW but he is not hit even once! Not in the head, not in the hand which he uses to hold the suit, not anywhere... 5. When shots are being taken, the bullets make metal noise when hitting the suit... so, is the suit made of metal? If that was true, it would have no malleability, he would walk like Robocop.

I found it to be a really bad movie because it became too unrealistic. If you don't mind about reality and just wanna see someone in a suit shooting tons of people, you will probably like it.",4
adamooo,"How this managed to sneak out of the editor's room at almost three hours in length is beyond me; I'm also confused as to how the script was so bland, with Keanu's repetition of ""Yeah"" in the same monotone voice and plain expression becoming something of a drinking game legend at this point.

Do you value your time? This movie trashes it completely and does away with respected conventions. In no world does this movie need to exist, but if it does, it needs to be tighter, and with better direction for the cast.

Most of our enjoyment came from Donnie Yen's performance., and each time Ian McShane opened his mouth enough to show us his ridiculous veneers.",3
mickwols,"Where do I start ? After fighting & killing about 400 blokes he gets run over by buses cars throws himself out of a 3rd story window onto a VW van , gets thrown down 300 concrete steps and yea you guessed it .... Get up and carries on light nothing happened !

It's insulting your intellect to even imagine him doing all this ? On top of that there's a blind man fighting 100 + assailants who doesn't get stabbed , shot , or even knocked out ü§£ who writes this nonsense? I love Reeves but this time it's too over the top to be real , embarrassing again and again ! Don't bother paying to see this crap.",1
iquotememesfun,"Henchmen just standing there, waiting to get hit, reacting to things that didn't hit them, people in the club just doing the same dance even while people are being killed right in front of them, the cars in traffic keeps moving even while people are getting killed, cars are crashing and bullets are flying, but nope.. traffic just keeps on going. I can't unsee any of it.

It looks painfully unnatural compared to how well the previous 3 films handled the fighting.

There's a ton of wasted movement and shot decisions based on making a scene look ""pretty"" rather than ""good.""

I know they can do better. I've seen it.

A couple cute twists of the story doesn't really carry the rest of the film, but it was at least still entertaining.",6
willz187,"I really liked the first 3. And really hated this one. I thought the action sequences were stupid like one that reminded me of the scene in Hot Rod where Andy Samberg goes flying down and a hill and doesn't stop for miles. Apparently this is one of John Wick's new superpowers, to be able to survive long falls. The Scout character is extra stupid and unnecessary. I don't understand his motivation. There's too many characters here that are supposed to be important. I just found everything confusing and redundant. There may have been one or two scenes that I liked but I can't even think which they are. Keannu is too slow now to pull these fight scenes off. Donnie reprises his role from Star Wars Rogue One. I just think it's a messy movie.",3
thePopcornExplorer,"I was never a big fan of this saga, even though the plot of these films is always basic, boring and predictable, the first one was kind of innovative in terms of the action and fighting sequences, but the rest were just more of the same.

Then all this buzz and hype came from the fourth so I was hoping they did some sort of revitalization of the saga and the first part of the movie indicated that but then its all ruined due to the same reasons as the previous installments.

There's no difference between this and super hero movies when it comes to the realism of the action scenes, the main character is indestructible, he can take punches, knifes, bullets (BUT he has a suit / vest that he uses to protect his face as you do when there's a bit of wind so I guess that makes sense), dozens of the best killers in the world, you see the point, he is a 1 man army with limitless stamina and upenetrable plot armor.

All of this becomes even more ridiculous when the fight scenes become slower as Keanu also ages, I mean I respect the man for doing his own stunts and he does look amazing for his age but come on.... and the fact that these boring unrealistic fighting scenes happen and the background regular people are just unfazed by it, is this suppose to be the Matrix as well? It just adds to the unrealistic environment.

I mentioned the movie started promising because there was a lot of interesting dialogue and character introduction, the stylization of different cultures and cities was also done well but then its lost on the predictable and ridiculous plot all over again... With that ending we still expect John Wick 5, seriously? It's so sickening these movies keep gaining millions, this worn out franchises, why do we continue to support this stuff....",5
vin0612,"I was super excited to watch the John Wick 4 movie and went with my cousin to the cinemas. Paid a bomb for the tickets and the popcorn... 15mins into the movie and i was wondering am i really watching chapter 4 !!

My cousin and i was laughing throughout the film as it felt like a comedy movie more than an action film... more than a john wick film..... chapter 4 has no story !!

It felt like a movie was presented to fill a 4 year gap... and they captialized on the john wick franchise to mint.

I could not bear to waste a moment more of my time on this utter crap... however with the amount of money paid to watch this nonsensical theatrics we stayed...dont ever recommend the movie to anyone.... - JUST DON'T.",1
jaapeelman,"Come on buys and girls: a solid 8 on imdb for his piece of crap? What an unbelievable dumb movie with a stupid story line although the previous 3 movies have the same problem. But the action and killing in this movie is over the top and a certain point boring because of the amount of attackers and John survives evrything. Unfortunately because after an hour I was only thinking: my God, kill the guy and get over with this movie. There is no humor in the movie, the ""story-line"" makes no sense at all and all the action is way over the top. It is not entertaining but only annoying and I really hope the guy is dead, will stay dead and no John Wick part 5. What a waste of more than 2,5 hours....",5
info-72714,"After three previous films, in which the story, the action and the humor formed a unity, this farewell film feels superfluous.

I will not fully describe the film, but after an 'Indiana Jones' (how this one is missed) opening, the film already collapses.

There are hardly any humorous dialogues, but identical fighting scenes plague your eyes for 2.40 hours.

It's impossible to keep watching seriously if all the characters just keep fighting after being fired at at close range several times.

You have to dream along with a movie and not take everything seriously, but when the hero is constantly hit by cars and thrown down stairs countless times, it starts to look like a cartoon.

Of course, I like Keanu and even look back at the earlier parts (particularly 1 and 2) with great pleasure, but this is expensive shoddy work. The fumbling with the nunchuks hurt my eyes: any 10-year-old child does this better.

In short: Keanu played his imperturbable character properly, but simply fell victim to poor direction and a meager story.",4
destinychild2014,"I never read the good reviews in anything. Movies, TV, Videogames... Never... I always read the bad reviews only.

When i see many reviews that say ""worst movie ever"" the chances are high that the movie is decent and worth a view. Those people never watch actually bad movies or they would know that there is no one worst movie ever... There is thousands of them...

When i see many reviews that say ""I'll never get those 2 hours back"" or ""i wasted 2 hours of my life"" i know that the movie is pretty good and I'm gonna like it. To those people... Just sleep less time some days. Even 5 minutes less a day can get you your wasted hours back in no time...

But when i see even just one review that complain about that the fourth movie of a franchise is the worst and the whole franchise sucks and yet they have sit through the whole franchise since they are able to criticize it, then the movie is a masterpiece... And Chapter 4 is a masterpiece... Enjoy if you are an action fan, you deserve thisüëçüëçüëç

Update: When i see reviews with the expression ""Are people blind""? The movie is probably an 11/10. Blind people have their other senses very enhanced and know better from people with mediocre levels of all of their sense and are completely ignorant about what subjective means...",10
Lythas_85,"I think the first one was the best.. because of the introduction of the character and how ruthless he is.

The second one was ok and him running away on parabellum started to get crazy and over the top.. him being hunted by every body started to get too much over top.. even too much unrealistic than it already was but we were still diggning... like him getting revenge for the dog was alrighjt, everybody was rooting for him for sure... but then.. it lost its purpose..

and then this movie .. dude, come on, why 3 if it was that easy.. i mean, it wasnt easy but it the possibility of the duel existed in the first place? And how conveniently this marquis was hiding in a corner waiting for his turn to appear... kinda like the eternals during the whole Thanos event.. they said they couldnt interfere.. but wait, their whole purpose was to use Earth to do something I wont say for spoiler purpose.. but you know, made no sense than not helping the avengers... but anyway, this marquis and the duel should have happened in the movie before.. or not at all like i said lol.. could have gone with wick saving someone or whatever.. i dont know..

imho, he is still alive but I imagine there wont be another one... unless this movie gets $$$$$ worlwide box office and then maybe.",5

movie-reviews-uk,"Let's be honest if, by now, you choose to see a ""John Wick"" movie then you know what's coming. Several hours of hyperkinetic, over the top violence with a pounding soundtrack and moody lighting. On this front ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" delivers and then some.

There isn't a plot that I can recall but once again our favourite assassin is wrestling with the unseen High Table and the price on his head is increasing faster than post-Covid inflation. So every goon in a suit is out to collect and John has to wade through a tsunami of bodies in order to, well, keep killing people.

Clearly there's no logic here as John has no identifiable motive anymore or even an end-goal in mind. Instead he's the main character in a video game and you're watching a Twitch stream of someone talented playing all the way through to the final boss.

At one point this characteristic is cemented, in spectacular fashion, when the camera shifts to a top-down view and you get to watch John move from room to room in a bloody spree. It's a fantastic sequence, right down to the spray of blood as henchmen #89 gets shot in the head at close range.

So is it a great film? Well yes because ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" plays it straight down the line and sticks religiously to its aesthetic. There are no in-jokes here, in fact there are more grunts than dialog, and the film absolutely believes in itself. On that front it's a right belter.",7
hjvergara,"""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is one of the most captivating, exciting, eye-popping, hyperkinetic, and beautiful action films ever made. Director Chad Stahelski has done the unthinkable; he has outdone himself in this fourth entry by taking a two hour and forty-nine-minute runtime (the longest in the series) and making it feel an hour shorter. This is a combat magnum opus, a relentless sensory experience, gorgeously hyperviolent, and easily the best in the series.

Baba Yaga is, once again, fighting to defeat the High Table while also facing a devilish and powerful new adversary (a disquieting and deviously memorable performance by Bill Skarsg√§rd as Marquis) in death-defying, blood-spurting, neon-blasting, stunts-to-spare, well-groomed, high-fashion style. Yes, the plot is rather simple, straightforward, and lacking in in-depth character background, but that hasn't been the strength of any of the Wick films anyway.

The masterful elements at play in ""Chapter 4"" begin with its colorful, even extravagant, and likeable supporting characters including Laurence Fishburne as the crafty Bowery, Clancy Brown as the cryptic Harbinger, Donnie Yen - electrifying as the blind, yet intuitive Caine - and most terrifically, Shamier Anderson as Tracker - a shady spy-like character that gives an indelible performance that ranges from brutal toughness to vulnerable subjugation.

Add heart-pounding sound effects and a pulsating musical score, striking nighttime, dark and gritty noir-inspired cinematography, and masterful fighting choreography that frames Wick in different cities with sumptuous vistas across the globe (the locales are outstanding from Sacr√© Coeur, to Arc de Triomphe, to the Louvre, to the Eiffel Tower in France to the opening scene in Aqaba, Jordan plus Berlin and Tokyo) and you end up with what feels like the most edgy, revolutionary, and most James Bond-esque entry yet.

The elaborate and visceral set designs are ""Chapter 4's"" crowning achievement; lavish and rich with detail, they put Wick in elegant and high-tech rooms, ornate buildings, rousing nightclubs, and most memorably, a long flight of stairs and heavily trafficked streets where gut-wrenching, head-popping fighting sequences ensue. It's a WICKedly wild ride from beginning to end that left me breathless, gasping, and exclaiming ""wow!"" in wonderment.",9
melinis-tomas,"If the first part of the film was very good. The second part is so mediocre. And the third part I watch with gritted teeth. It is the fourth part that you have to spare your time, have patience and feel sorry for yourself that you are still watching. Part four does not have an interesting plot. It has no meaningful dealogues. The dealogues are like 2 weak minded people having a conversation. Just pointless. There are so many shootings and fights in the film that it's just boring to watch. You can't keep your attention on the endless gunfights and fight scenes. There are so many illogical places in the film that you start to get angry at the film. John is like some kind of superman. Maybe this is a Marvel movie? And I thought, on principle, if I watched this film not in the cinema but on home video. And I would get through all the action scenes and just watch the dialogue and the key scenes of the film and I wouldn't lose anything. And the film would last me about half an hour. And I would be completely satisfied with the quality.",3

The bullets have no impact on John. Falling off a 5-story building has no impact on him either. Just gets up. But the movie is not called ""Superman.""

The dialogue was written by a 12 year old.

It tries to be funny by having a dog bite the testicles off one of the bad guys and then pee on that dead bad guy. Seems to have worked because almost the entire theater burst into laughter.

There's no real people in this movie, only assassin's and people dancing. D. Yen plays a blind martial artist, just for a change! There's no real story line, just fight scenes after fight scenes. The suits are like the protective shields from Dune. Each fight scene is boring as there's no real investment in the characters. John Wick says literally about 8 words in the whole movie. One word at a time, normally just a single name. I can't believe this gets such a high rating. Honestly it was painful to watch.",3
gradd-67422,"I m beginning to believe that all those high rated reviews are either planted or submitted by underaged people or uneducated boomers. Especially those who call this a potentially best action movie ever must certainly be off the reservation.

The film is literally a longer copied version (2h49m) of the previous 3. Theres nothing new with the characters, no new exploration, no arcs, no development. Just more double crossing and more of the same action scenes that we ve seen in the previous 3 films. If John Wick killed 500 enemies in this film, 250 of them died in the classic MMA-->Reload pistol--->Shoot them in the head style. We ve seen this move being repeated again and again and again since the 1st installment and now they are shoving it into our faces for almost 3 hours.

If we wanna talk basic, just basic, realism, well... then lets talk about the complete absence of any form of police force while there is a ground war happening under the Arc of Triumph, or the church stairs.

John Wick is getting an armored suit upgrade every film. Tony Stark would be jealous and probably would steal the design for his ""learn from my mistakes"" theme. Wick falls off buildings, luckily theres just one car under the building and Wick happens to jump right at the spot where that one car is parked, but even then from that height, half of his body should have been broken. Guess his armored suit is from Vibranium and absorbs kinetic energy and all types of vibrations.

Obviously his enemies are all baboons on easy mode who cant even shoot a target dummy at 2 meters, but given the state of bulletproof armors in the film, his enemies decide to use Dragon's Breath rounds so that Wick can loot them off their corpse like a Call of Duty protagonist to counter the amount of armored enemies he encounters.

I honestly could write 20 more paragraphs with all the negative parts of this film, but i think i wrote enough. The only reason i m rating this as 3 and not 1, is because in the very little amount of time that Mr. Keanu Reeves got to actually act as John Wick, he managed to maintain his unique calm and chill persona throughout two and a half hours of fighting and shooting, pain and bleeding.",3

There were a few creative aspects to the fight scenes, cinematography and effects, but in terms of the writing the whole movie was just one long incessant fight scene repeated what felt like hundreds of times without any story to break it up or make any of it matter at all to the viewer. In action movies it's obviously about the action and not much is needed to make the story 'matter' but my goodness at least have the basics of an actual story that makes the action compelling in some basic way. There were a number of excellent actors in this movie but sadly the writing made it so that even they couldn't contribute anything to the story. Went in excited but I seriously wanted to walk out about half way through when I realized it was just going to be non-stop fight scenes and nothing else for 3 whole hours. It was truly mind-numbing.",5
roxlerookie,"I watched a 3h headshot fest where john wick chooses to let himself die on the street after getting shot by a blind man .

Several things bothered me. Mostly the script being appalling / cringe / bland.

I'm French, yet the shootouts in Paris involve American muscle cars, random bad guys and lots of automatic guns. I would have liked to see something a bit more local / that'd ring more true.

Why does JW need to fall from a 3-4 storey building, get hit / run over by 5 cars, and literally fall hundreds of stairs? It's Deadpool level of trauma, but he's meant to only be human. If he can withstand that, why does he die at the end from flesh wounds?

Why pick Scott Adkins to actually act? I'm sure he's buddies with Chad (the director), but the guy can't act, and barely had fight scenes. It also made no sense his character would be such a good fighter.

Why do we get such a lame, young villain? There are much, much better villains out there.

Why have some of the action in Japan?

I guess they wanted to film in Paris, so they made the villain French (I think?). Except he's Swedish, and just doesn't feel French at all

Didn't we deserve anything fresh? We got a recycling of: Kevlar suits, black full body armors (but this time around they're not nearly as bulletproof?), swords, attack dogs, American muscle car scene, motorbike scene. I mean come on.

And why is the man killing John blind? Did he need to be blind?

Visually, it all looked very good. Nothing we haven't seen before, but very visually pretty, the lighting especially. The killing go so repetitive that they switched to full on video game mode with camera from above. It was kind of cool, but also very silly as it felt again like playing a video game on rookie mode.

All in all, an extremely long movie despite zero character / story development, suffering from remarkably bad writing & casting. In a way I'm glad John died because I know i'd keep watching the sequels, like the F&F movies, and feeling dirty afterwards.",5
NinjutheGreat,"Very very bad story, chaotic motives Outplayed protagonist by the villains

Very few fresh action elements and the old ones are really robotic and under choreographed.... boring.

I really don't understand why is rated above 7.4

For me this move was a bit of parody as well, but not in the good way :) Really don't understand why it is needed in this way after the first 3 movie

If you cut the first 30 minutes and the last2 this could be the worst movie in the franchise but still ok.

Watching the first action scenes with the so robotic and boring actions... time to retire retire the franchise.",1
samuelmills-81017,I absolutely am amazed by this film I wasn't expecting it to be that brilliant whenever the camera zooms out into the city's omg my mouth dropped the fights are like 45 to 35 mins and it's extremely brutal and the reason I'm reviewing on 23rd is cause UK released it early and I watched it at 6pm today it was absolutely amazing and brilliant the new villians was wow crazy marquis tracker Caine and many more the ending was unexpected and very sad there's no slow moments it's extremely intense and gruesome in parts so it's not for the faint of heart this film should be 18 in UK idk how it got 15 but I recommend ppl over 14+ can handle it I hope everyone enjoys this film 10/10 best film of the year if I had to rank it John wick 3 John wick 1 John wick 2 and my number 1 is John wick chapter 4 so that's my review on John wick chapter 4 I hope everyone likes the review.,10
Dominantxx,"As Mr Wick nears the end of his journey, we are given a delight of a story well structured across its constant world building. It gives a never-ending stream of new structural and actionable aspects that feel natural as it progresses, from the action, to plot points, and personal development. An intertwining of interests rooted in common found circumstances, history, connection, as well as coincidence and luck. As he came back into this life a free man, he wills to fight to leave just as he came no matter the cost. As the nature of it expands with new and unsurprising aspects, this feature more than delivers and entertains.",10
nederlandhiker-22571,"By far the worst of the four unless you are a brainless action junkie looking for a fix.

It didn't take much writing for this one, everyone wants to kill John and John kills everyone, the end.

The first three chapters at least had a break where a storyline appeared and there was some dialogue between the actors that added to the story in between fight scenes. The fourth one seemed to be no more than a poorly written attempt at cashing in on the first three. Profit seemed to be the motivating factor.?

On the upside, the action scenes were good, though like drinking, it may have been better served if done in moderation, with a little time left over for a story.",4
gekkepoppetje,"I like to watch people getting killed. Give me a movie where people are getting killed for 3 hours and I'll be happy. Then you've come to the right place in Hollywood. Hollywood is for the mob what was once the arena in ancient Rome, but the light version. The rabble, ignorant, feasting on big screens where violence is shown as necessary, tough and sexy. John Wick is like American porn: do you like chocolate? Then we'll drown you in it. The film has a total lack of drama, a total lack of imagination and, even worse, a total lack of humour. After the umpteenth headshot I look bored at my lukewarm popcorn. Kenau Reeves, the Internet's darling of good deeds, plays a depressed killer in a black suit who does nothing but kill people. A feast to watch for the poor in spirit. Hollywood: we've got millions and what do we do? Portraying human ugliness like it is sexy.",1
vivaansuperhero,"Keanu Reeves is freaking Awesome this is by far his best performance yet. Director Chad Stahelski gives us the Best Action movie in the history of Cinema. The action is crisp well directed and it is beautifully choreographed. The villains are the best in the franchise Billy Sarsgard and Donnie Yen are amazing. The rest of the cast is awesome as well. The directing, writing , plot ,ending and the begging is perfect. It never feels too long or short , the runtime is well handled. The side characters like Winston,Killa and Charon once again steal the big screen every time they appear in the movie.",10
MatthewMichaelHoffman,"SCORE: 7.2/10

The biggest roller coaster of roller coasters I've ever been on while watching a movie in theaters. It was good, then it was bad, then it was great, then boring, then absolutely amazing, then disappointing. If we are speaking solely about the Action, this was the greatest Action movie of all time. Every fight was legendary and the new tricks and weapons they used were unlike anything I've ever seen before. The exploding shotgun, the ultra-realistic fighting choreography, and the entire world getting bossed up by Mr. Wick. If the movie were just all of the fight scenes mashed together, this may have been a perfect movie. However, unfortunately, as movies tend to go, there also happens to be a story element to them. And for John Wick 4, it was atrocious and easily the worst story in the franchise.

Anytime the new villain was on screen it was a complete snooze fest, apart from the end where he gets a bullet in the head. Some of those scenes went on way too long and made some of the Action scenes less impactful because of what we had to go through to get there. I was excited when I saw the 2hr and 49 minute runtime, as I loved the first 3 John Wicks, but this movie had no business being that long. So much of it should've been cut out. There was way too much plot armor given to the head of security for the High Table and the guy he meets the card table, which made it felt forced at times. I have no problem with all the plot armor given to John Wick, but I was not a fan of those other characters being portrayed in that way.

Now for the 2 most problematic parts of the movie. For one, can they make up their mind when it comes to the relationship between John and Caine and the Tracker? They're fighting against each other and then working together and then fighting against each other and then working together and then half fighting against each other and half working together. It felt sloppy and inconsistent in a way that was not productive. Lastly, HE DIES? You have got to be kidding me. It's not just the fact that he dies, but it's the way it happens. Granted, there is probably a 99% chance he's still alive, but absolutely nothing in his final conversation with Caine and Winston made me thinking he was dying. And now he just collapses over on the stairs and it cuts to his tombstone? For everything he was able to endure throughout the 4 films, it was a pretty pathetic way to end the movie and it felt like a slap in the face. John Wick deserved way better. We also still got virtually nothing about his wife apart from a single flashback, an element that should've been explored by now.

This movie review is long because I'm very passionate about John Wick and I love his character and the movies that came before this one. To end on a positive note, there were still a bunch of good things that happened in this film that were just unfortunately watered down by the length of the film and the rest of the story. The humor was phenomenal, both Caine and the Tracker's character were great additions, and there were a lot of high impact scenes, such as John saving the Tracker's dog. Lastly, RIP to the legend Lance Reddick. I know he didn't have a major part in this movie, but he has given a memorable performance in each of the prior movies and was so talented. Taken from us way too soon.",7
donage,"After the hundredth henchman fails to shoot John Wick on the head you might be thinking 'aren't these guys supposed to be well trained?'

The movie had very little stakes and even less plot. At times you could see stunt men missing their cues and their marks. Usually you can ignore it but violence was all this movie had so I expected better. Watching a stunt man stumble around for five seconds until Keanu was ready for him took me right out of it. For a movie that went to great lengths to advertise how the actions scenes were accomplished I felt cheated.

The plot was laughable. Honestly I thought this movie would try to explain parts of the high table, gangs and why an American homeless man has millions of dollars in paintings stored in a train station in Paris.

We heard someone snoring in the cinema.",1
subxerogravity,"Far better than I was expecting. Not that I thought it was going to be a bad movie in the slightest, but I was not expecting to be so bedazzled by it. John Wick has stepped up to the plate and hit that man meal out of the park every single time. Keanu Reeves and filmmaker Chad Stahelski have done everything in their power to keep the action constant.

The odd part about that is that this movie did not have the best action sequences out of all the movies, but it did have the most in depth story. That itself is odd considering that John Wick movies are not about story. That is why this whole thing started over the fact that the son of some crime boss killed the dog his late wife gave him. It's a humorous plot that commits to the Franchise's statie of action film plots, but this movie decides to take itself a little more serious than all the others, really focusing on how far Wick has gone down the rabbit hole snice the first film. Surprising but not bad.

Then you have the action, done by some of the best in the world. John Wick 4 feels like one of those episodes of the Mandalorian that's not about the Mandalorian at all. Afterall when you have Donnie Yen in the movie you want to make sure he's doing as many cool action sequences as possible, which means that there were a few times in this movie in which John disappears to allow others to shine. Great as far as the action.

Also great, Scott Adkins in a fat suit. Now I want them to do a spin off movie with Scott Adkins in that fat suit.

I would keep going but I do not want to be as long as the movie was. Do not worry you don't even notice. The film is too hard hitting for that.",9
masonsaul,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is an action masterpiece, an emotionally investing, unashamedly pretentious and extremely satisfying final chapter that continues to celebrate stunt work as the art form it absolutely is and deliver franchise high spectacle that really does put the majority of other action films to shame.

Keanu Reeves is even more agile than ever and continues to really impress in the action despite being 4 films in. Once again though, it's not just the action he excels at with the sense of finality this time around adding a sombre and contemplative nature to his performance that is beautiful.

The supporting cast is insanely stacked, a definite new record for this franchise. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne play to their familiar strengths and really dial them up. Then there's the newcomers, starting with Shamier Anderson who has a really interesting angle to his character that's a lot of fun.

Rina Sawayama makes a terrific screen debut and has great chemistry with Hiroyuki Sanada who can do no wrong and his reunion with Reeves is a joy to see. Bill Skarsg√•rd is another memorable villain for this franchise as a character who dresses like a gentleman but acts like the complete opposite.

Scott Adkins plays against type in hilarious fashion and then there's Donnie Yen. Obviously he's perfect in the action scenes and just so cool but on top that he's one of the best characters because his conflict with John isn't as black and white as previous antagonists, making it all the more interesting.

Chad Stahelski's direction is phenomenal, the action scenes are still super clean and impeccably choreographed. There's a nightclub scene that actually improves over the original, a fight in oncoming traffic that's jaw droppingly good and a one take that is one of the best of all time.

The film also offers an excellent reminder that Stahelski is an amazing visual stylist as well. With Dan Laustsen's cinematography he creates a beautifully film that makes each location visually unique and the lighting in particular is just stunning throughout.

The pacing is so good, gaining momentum early on and never letting up. The music by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard is once again incredible, bringing back all the greatest hits without solely relying on them and actually creating the most unique score of the four with plenty of new pieces.",10
FlashCallahan,"John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table, and earning his battered body, a much deserved freedom.

But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe, and forces that turn old friends into foes......

First of all, any film that features Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins is a must for any action film aficionado. But to have them in a John Wick film isn't just a dream come true, it's a work of sheer genius. I've had my expectations high for several films this year, such as Pants Man, Cocaine Bore, and Scream VI, which have all let me down.

So I tried to lower my expectations for this, but I couldn't. Because this franchise has just been getter bigger and better with each instalment. And does it meet expectations?

Too bloody right it does, it's a masterpiece in set pieces and going above and beyond in pleasing the fans.

There are five huge set pieces that are wonderfully staged, and they are brutal and unflinching, and usurp anything from the previous three movies.

The first is at Shimazus Continental, and although it goes on for a while, it's breathtaking, reminiscent of the shootout at the end of Parrabellum, but with Yen making good use of an everyday household item, and the icing on the cake for this sequence, Wick using nunchucks. That's all you need to know. Wick using nunchucks.

The second features again, Yen, but now we have Scott Adkins thrown in. And for good measure, he's wearing a fat suit. Again, beautifully staged, with Wick suffering badly this time at the hands of Adkins, with a beautiful diegetic piece from Le Castlevania, keeping the tradition of the franchise. If you though a pencil was a good weapon, wait until you see what is used here.

Thirdly, and arguably the best, we have a shoot out around the Arc De Triumphe. A ballet of cars and bullets that had me on the edge of my seat. It's so seamless and expertly made, I doubt you'll find a better cinematic action scene this decade. It's that beautiful.

Fourthly, we have a wonderful over head long take with Wick taking out bad guys from room to room, using the most unique gun of the series. It's literally a blast.

And the most bone crunching and funniest sequence is on the steps leading to the church. It puts The Exorcist to shame.

All this clocking in at nearly three hours, and I didn't once find the film bloated or lagging. As for Reeves, he's a movie star. Some of his acting is pretty questionable in the film, but the man has screen presence, and by his performance, he's dedicated to the cause of Wick.

What let the side down a little was Skarssgards pantomime portrayal of the villain. He's far too camp to be in the least but threatening, and the 'help' Wick received from the tracker was a little too convenient at times.

But minor quibble aside, this is a masterpiece of action, it's balls to the wall from the moment you see the Thunder Road PC logo, right until the fade of the last scene.

This is everything you've expected and more. If you are a fan of the action genre, see this, you've deserved it.

Look out for a Wilhelm scream, and a stinger.

arjunash-62280,"And we are just luckiest people to be alive at such times. Not just best John wick movie or the one of the best action movie but a Truly Beautiful Movie (yes hundreds of people does die brutally here) but the way every scene especially the fight choregraphy is shot, its nothing short of a masterpiece. From the great actors, to the epic storyline, the comedic scenes (yes there would be many) to the extraordinary breath taking scenes, its all just perfect. The 2nd best movie i ever saw in theatres (after the endgame ofcourse). Nonethless, its a movie worth missing everything for, just go out there watch it in theatres especially in 4DX. Or you might just regret it for the rest of your lives!",10
PlotThicc,"JW4 is exceptional!! If you're gunna see anything this wkd, see John Wick Chapter 4.

It's a nonstop, adrenaline-fueled rollercoaster ride full of tension, action and suspense. And you don't have to be up to speed with the other JW films, necessarily. The 2nd Act is dedicated to JW enthusiasts, but it's not too difficult to follow.

There's also an unrecognizable moviestar in hair & makeup (and a fat suit) that I clocked (I won't spoil it--yet). He is hilarious in the role -- very much like Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) in ""Tropic Thunder.""

The 3rd Act of JW4 is worth the price of admission. This is, by far, the best movie of the year (so far) and the last hour is one of the best finales of any action film in recent memory.

Shoutout to the production crew. This film doesn't work without the crew. The stunt coordinators, the sound mixers/designers, safety staff, grips, hair & makeup, choreographers, costumers and the animal trainers. Phenomenal job across the board!!!!!

Treat yourself to JW4 this wkd. Stay for the post-credit scene, if you can.

RIP Lance Reddick--",10
ThunderKing6,"I was rooting for the dog to get a treat. It deserved one because it was ""well"" ""trained"".

Besides the ""well"" ""trained"" dog. This movie was a bore.

This review was made in the month of April the 14th in the year 2023. In century 21st.

What was this movie about?: Honestly I can't remember what the last 3 were about. I know I enjoyed them.

This one was about people being tortured by the dog.

John Wick plays fugitive but with many gun battles.

The story and the production overview: It was boring. The only deeming quality was the Asian Daredevil. Wick got whoop throughout the movie.

The Kraven the hunter character was one of those mixed unsure characters. He behaves one way then the other.

I hated his dog. Kraven the Hunter was a dognutter in this.

The dog being unphased after slamming into a vehicle was hash.

The pitbull at the end was unnecessary to have in the movie. The movie was more about dogs than having a good movie.

Genre: Fightin/shooting/secret society Soundtrack: mix it was fine.

Duration: 2 long hour of enduring a worthless mutt.

UnHighlight: the dog. Very cringe.

Highlight: Asian Daredevil

What can be learned?: well watching serious movie was a good change from the comedic MCU films.

Seems like serious movies are on the edge of extinction.

Verdict: I was bored and wanted to sleep.",2
nigepitz,"JW4 has received rave reviews from critics and audiences alike but that's a mystery to me. JW1 introduced us to the world of the Continental, JW himself was tough but vulnerable and funny and the fight scenes were like nothing we'd seen before. It still had one foot in reality.

But from JW2 onwards Mr Wick has become indestructible, an unkillable superhero with magical powers. Sure there were some good moments in 2 and 3 and some wonderful choreography but for me, everything that made the first instalment so amazing is missing from JW4. The humour has gone and many of the set piece fights look like they were shot during rehearsals when they were being practiced at half speed. You can see the stunt men waiting for their cue to attack. Worst of all though, it's boring. I had to turn it off and go back to it the next day. The bullet proof suits are ridiculous and reminded me of the missteps of the Bond franchise before the Craig reboot - (invisible car?) Keananunu is obviously older now and can't throw himself around like he could back in the day and maybe this is one of the problems. The biggest though is that when the protagonist is indestructible there is no jeopardy so therefore no interest.",4
quickdraw88,"A dramatic step down in quality from previous entries in the series.

The main drawcard being the action sequences and gunplay. Sadly in chapter 4 they lack any stakes and become boring and repetitive almost instantly. Bullets have no effect or simply pass through people, stuntmen routinely stumble while waiting for their queue to attck then die, basics like taking cover take a back seat to flashy unnecessary spin that some one thought ""looked cool"". Many sequences just look like a bad dress rehearsal they decided to keep.

Unnecessary characters that add nothing to the already non existent plot. Streets or famous landmarks are completely empty or filled with bystanders that appear to be in a different dimension, oblivious to the insane acts of violence occurring next to them until it suits the plot or they vanish into thin air from one shot to the next. Not a single police car or officer called out the entire movie. In possibly the most unrealistic scene, an entire subway train in Osaka is empty. This is a movie that holds the same level of quality and planning you'd expect from a bunch of 7 year old boys playing bang bang in their back yard. ""My suit is bullet proof"" you hear them yell as you chuckle and sigh, ""ah kids.."" You really really need to switch off your brain to enjoy this 3hr slog, or just laugh at how poorly planned and executed the entire idea is.

I can understand people wanted this to be good and rated it highly because these types of movies are indeed in short supply these days and I also want to see more quality adult action movies made. But lets be honest, even with a high budget this is just plain old fashioned below average shlock. ""Wrap it up"" someone said, too bad there's no bow on this one.",4
benjaminskylerhill,"John Wick: Chapter 4 joins Mad Max: Fury Road in being the fourth film in an action franchise that is also hands-down the best film in its franchise.

The pacing issues present in the last two movies are nowhere to be seen here; remarkable, given the behemoth 169-minute runtime. It absolutely earns that runtime with action sequences that never once feel repetitive and a plot that is always moving.

Every single gloriously carnage-filled set piece introduces unique geography, weaponry, and style to the mix so that every scene is more shocking and thrilling than the last. I can't remember the last time I was so consistently entertained for nearly three straight hours.

This time around there are also several new characters introduced, and they're all given much more personality and narrative purpose than anything we've seen before in these films. For the first time in four movies, I actually got invested in the story on multiple levels rather than just being thoroughly entertained by the action.

But it must also be acknowledged that this movie is absolutely insane, and is not meant to be taken seriously. John Wick is an invincible man, frequently surviving things no man can possibly survive. If implausibility bothers you, this will be your nightmare.

The story does try to dive deeper into the theme of ""actions have consequences, and nobody is immune to consequences"" that was touched upon in the previous movies. I commend them for trying, but it's still done in a far too surface-level way to be impactful. The writers really glossed over some pretty heavy plot points whose consequences should have been explored in greater detail, and because of this, I didn't feel anything I think they wanted me to feel when the film ended.

But this is a minor complaint for a movie like this. Chapter 4 is the display of a master action filmmaker who continues to dare to go bigger and bolder, and I can't wait to see what kind of spectacle he presents us with next.",9

He survives being hit by a car at full speed not once but 5! Times in 5 minutes. Oh, and falls from a building (again) and totals the car but just walks off.

And then they try to be funny with the dog biting nuts, him rolling down the stairs like it's an episode of Family guy.

And to top it all off, the blind guy shoots better than John f'n Wick.

Give me a f'n break.

The only reason for not giving it a 1* is cus I like Keanu.",2
FilmFanatic2023,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is the latest installment in the popular action franchise starring Keanu Reeves as the titular assassin. Directed by Chad Stahelski, who helmed all the previous films, this sequel continues the story of John Wick's quest for freedom from The High Table, a mysterious organization that rules over the underworld. Along the way, he faces new enemies and allies, as well as old friends and foes.

The movie is a feast for action fans, as it showcases some of the most impressive and inventive fight scenes ever put on screen. From gunfights to knife fights, from car chases to horse chases, from Paris to Tokyo, John Wick: Chapter 4 never lets up on the adrenaline and excitement. Keanu Reeves once again proves his dedication and skill as an action star, performing most of his own stunts and delivering his trademark deadpan humor.

The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsg√•rd plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.

The movie is not without its flaws, however. At nearly three hours long, it feels bloated and overstuffed at times. Some scenes drag on for too long or feel unnecessary. Some plot points are confusing or underdeveloped. Some characters are underused or wasted. The movie also relies heavily on fan service and references to previous films, which may alienate newcomers or casual viewers.

Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years. It delivers more of what fans love about this series: stunning action sequences, cool visuals, charismatic performances, and intriguing lore. It also leaves room for more potential stories in this universe.",8
martinmatt-81974,"Just got home from the theaters and man oh man was this one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. This is legitimately a MASTERPIECE. I've seen a lot of films and I think this is the best action film I've seen. Definitely the best action film saga. I had to wait in the theater for a long time because I was just so blown away by how well made this film was.

The lighting has evolved with each movie and it was absolutely stunning. And that goes along with the cinematography. Just absolutely beautiful shots. And of course the choreography was incredibly well orchestrated. AND THE PEOPLE WHO DID THE STUNTS. There seriously needs to be an Oscar for choreography and stunt work.

This one is for Lance Reddick. We all love him and will miss him dearly. Bravo.",10
eoinpgeary,"John Wick Chapter 4 comes with a bang! John wants to clear his name and be done with the table but the route of getting there this time is much harder a task than we have seen before.

There are so many highlights of the movie, the action was all superb ! I already after first watch have a favourite which is hard to pick as there are some AMAZING sequences in the movie. I won't say the location because I want to give nothing away but I will say in Paris with a lot of traffic !

This movie delves into the characters way more than before, we get really good time with the side characters, usually a movie like this would give them 10-15 minutes screen time and kill them while this isn't the case, in the time sense. We get motive, we get their struggle and really good interactions with John. My favourite side characters were Nobody, Shimazu, and Caine.

John takes some hits, serious fall damage but these are the movies not real life hahaha. It's a spectacle on a grand scale.

Very small nitpicks, the fights are all superb but I would like some more intimate fights for eg JW1, when they entered his house it felt more threatening, and that's it hahaha it's personal preference as a nitpick which is pretty darn good.

JW4 is definitely the best of the sequels and up there with the first in my opinion! 8.5/10.",9
mahdinaimi,"I normally don't write reviews but this movie just pushed the boundaries of absurdity so far that I just can't say nothing!

We get it, John Wick never dies, OK!

But at least put a tiny bit of reason into the movie!! He jumps out of the window from the third floor, lands on car, THE CAR'S ROOF GETS SMASHED!!!, but he just stands up and continues fighting???

And some scenes are so ridiculous that the whole cinema was laughing. Like the scene near the ending where he is literally just rolling himself down the staircase for no reason! You can literally see him push his arms to the ground to roll one more stair flight down!

Even if you don't think about what you're watching, the action scenes get boring too quickly! Repetitive style of fighting, same movements from Chapter 1, and then covering themselves from bullets with just a sleeve (???) And then penetrating that sleeve with a knife!

I felt like Keanu Reeves was just telling me ""Give me your money and don't think about what I'm showing you, cuz I like the money!""

Seriously! The movie had nothing new to show! Same old story... same old fighting... literally nothing new! We get it, you make good fortune out of this! But at least have SOMETHING NEW when you're taking your audience's bucks.... for example, the three other chapters had at least some good dialogs, but this one.... maybe it's me, but Keanu's performance is just going down in these kind of movies....",1
olhpickering,"Spoiler alert.

It's John Wick. You know what your in for and it looks good, and the action is good in places. But, long story short, there is no point in any of the events in this film happening. It also pretty much renders 2 and 3 null and void.

Everything he did, going against the high table, trying to get out, is undone because he just dies. If he'd got killed at the start nothing would have been any different. He manages to get out from under the High table but just dies so why bother? Okay, you can listen to Reeves and the director waffle on about this and that but who cares?

""For him to get his peace, or freedom, in a way... that was the reason to make the movie. It can't just be, 'Let's do another one'. It was really about death, or a way of dying. We were really inspired by the Hagakure.""

Great, cheers Keanu.

Another theme seems to be consequences and facing them... okay fine, other characters do keep pointing out that he's getting everyone killed with HIS actions and he is. But y'know, surely he'll redeem himself and achieve something. Nope.

You could also argue that he sacrifices himself to save his friend and his daughter but again who cares about that? The daughter is in it for about 20 seconds (and is less of a character then John's car was in the first film) but nevertheless he helped them and that's a positive. Oh wait, the post credits scene it's going to make sure even that small spark of hope gets snuffed out.

It's a mean spirited and cynical film, that relies far too much on magic kevlar suits to mask the paucity of new ideas (although the ""dragon breath"" scene is cool) and just leaves a sour taste, even though it didn't have to. There are so many narratively satisfying ways to kill off a main character but this managed to miss every single one of them.

The first one is brilliant. Lightning in a bottle. Turning it into a franchise bloated it and then killed it stone dead.",5
therealjaysmoke,"Finally got the chance to watch this movie and I have to say, everything you'd expect from a John Wick movies, you got it. From the cinematography to the color grading, to the special Fx. So I wasn't moved by that at all. We all know that 3 was bad, but 4 was abysmal. I don't know what the directors were thinking making the main antagonist, Caine, a BLIND man. I mean, how were you going to sell this to fans of John Wick who know him to be am amazing gunslinger? And you telling me, he can't shoot a blind man dead from a few yards away? What load of rubbish is that? That spoilt the whole movie for me.

And then you had Mr Nobody, who I really didn't understand what he was doing in the movie with his dog. Then you had all the awful and predictable fight scenes. It was such a pain to watch, you could tell it wasn't real as the fighters would pause, waiting for Keanu to make a move then they responded. I don't know if it was Keanu who was slow or what, it was just wrong. And the Marquis guy's acting was just terrible.

The story was very weak IMO, not as rich as the first and second. This is the 4th chapter, I was expecting something rad! But everything here we've seen before in previous John Wick movies, the only crazy moment was the unexpected death of Winston's concierge.

My conclusion is a simple question: how hard is it for a whole John Wick to shoot a blind man?",4
neilprescott-19521,"I am absolutely baffled by the 8.4 rating on here of this movie. Watched this in the cinema last night and its the worse movie I've seen in the cinema for a long time. I have never been so bored. No apparent storyline, repetitive, noisy, scene after scene of people fighting each other and shooting people from 2 inches away and wooden acting by Keanu Reeves. I was bored after 30 minutes and couldn't wait for it to finish. The only good thing about the movie was the dog that was in it. 3hrs of my life I will never get back. If anyone is considering going to watch this in the cinema I wouldnt bother wasting your evening.",1
soham-21358,"'Brilliant' word will be an understatement for this film .This is Chad Stahelski's finest piece of work . John wick 4 is visually stunning and at the same time is engaging .The running length is almost 3 hour but feels like 2 hr . The editing is crisp and on point . The action choreography and Set pieces are phenomenal . John Wick 4 is arguably the best action movie of this decade . The stellar star cast comprised Keanu Reeves , Doni Yen , Ian McShane , Hiroyunki Sanada,Bill Skarsgard ,Scott Adkins ,Laurence Fishburne and Late Lance Reddick etc are apt in their respective role .Kudos to the director and his team for gifting us such an amazing cinematic experience .",10
jancapek-cz,"I really liked this film. For the first 90 minutes or so. Then, as the body count exceeded what I thought to be roughly 15 thousand souls, I started to feel like I was missing out on life. The feeling grew exponentially, with every batch of 5 thousand casualties.

When John Wick began his ascent to the top of Sacr√© Coeur, where he faced a hundred new villains (probably the planet's last surviving human male specimens), I considered leaving. But it was Mr. Nobody yelling his ""balls"" cormmand (whereupon his dog jumps at a man's crotch, and then urinates over his dead body) that achieved the feat.

On my way home, I reminisced about the good old days, when an action-loaded, far-fetched but highly entertaining movie could be squeezed into 87 minutes (e.g. Commando, 1985; btw. 51% of the running time of John Wick: Chapter 4).

Anyway, ChatGPT informs me that ""There is no clear evidence to suggest that watching stupid films or any other form of entertainment can significantly lower a person's IQ,"" so it's not all bad. But I lost good lunch money and 3 hours of my life, and there's no refund on these.",2
Carolyn_Channing,"It's awesome to see how John Wick franchise has progressed, four movies in and it still has that same aesthetic, top to bottom, this film was just amazing. The editing was spot on, the scenery and focal shots are amazing, All of the actors were outstanding, the effects were some of the greatest I have ever seen, and the variety in the fight sequences was refreshing and new.

The director and writer really nailed the action and entertainment in this movie. Honestly I was little worried that they couldn't keep up with the franchise going at such a high level, I'm glad it was not the case with this one.",10
scootm16,"As of now, this is the best movie of 2023; that being said, it still has it's issues. I'll start by saying the action sequences (all 9,000 of them) are breathtakingly choreographed. John Wick's trademarked 'GunFu' is on full display in Chapter 4 (for better or worse). This chapter easily has the highest body count out of the series, but you can't rely on bodies and bullets as your main focal point, especially if it's supposedly the last chapter (I highly doubt it is). Wick is weighed down by plot armor so thick it deflects literally everything, including the viewer's belief that Mr. Wick will ever be in any danger. Hit by 10 cars? Tis but a scratch!

My main issue with Chapter 4 is that the plot is very thin and it's stretched out over 3 hours. This chapter is very 'Beginning. Middle. End'. The beginning and end are 5 minutes a piece, while the middle is two and a half hours of John effortlessly walking through goons (which is great, until it's not). I love me some Wick slaughtering goons, but when 95% of the movie is gun fire, you begin to forget what the plot even is, what the movie's even about, which is not good. This movie could've easily been cut down to 2 hours if they edited the fight scenes to a reasonable time, so I hope you don't like plot with your action.

Another gripe I had is the fact that John Wick had like maybe 10 lines of dialogue? The guy barely spoke a word throughout the entirety of the movie, and when he did speak, 99% of the time it was him going ""Yeah..."" (which is great, until it's not). Maybe use Keanu/Wick as a vehicle for the plot instead of having him be a mute protagonist of an FPS video game? He's the title character for God sake! In Chapters 1 and 2, Wick showed a lot of emotion and vulnerability through dialogue and acting (at least more than this chapter) to express himself, but in this he is pretty much the Doomslayer. Also, is it just me or was Keanu's acting extra bad in this one? The line delivery sometimes was just... oof, even for Keanu standards.

My favorite part of the movie is a top-down one-take scene near the end where Wick is blasting through goons with incendiary ammo.

Overall, the movie is a good time and if you're a Wick fan, then you won't be disappointed. I'd say this is a step up from Chapter 3, but not as good as 1 and 2.

7.2/10.",7
andreagrossi-69,"Seriously.

This is a videogame. Lot of fight with a boss to defeat each time and the final boss.

Nothing new, nothing that we haven't already seen. Some fights are so incredibly lame (opponents seems to goof around just to wait for the hero to get ready rather than attack and kick his ass into orbit) that they just not make sense. Or maybe the director think we the audience are all a bunch of stupid children.

The first John Wick made sense. It was about a man who kicked some asses and got kicked for good.

This one is more like one of the hundreds dumb superheroes (please.... The suit that deflect the projectiles is so utterly ridicolous that not even the excuses ""it's made out of kevlar"" can stand on its feet) that already are clogging the theatres and the tv on demand.

We don't really need another one that turn a good idea, a good character and a potentially good franchise in a pile of fuming, smelly manure. Once again.

To me there is only one Jonny Wick. The first one. All the rest are for the childrens who cannot see beyond the pewpew and the eyesore of the special effect and the dumb fighting scenes.

Sorry. Not sorry.",1
Thetruthhurts22,"The first John Wick was a masterpiece. They went down from there. Each one less than the last but still providing some Interesting plots and action.

Now we have arrived at John Wick 4. Nothing is as good as the previous movies. The martial art action is far more Tae Kwon Do-ish than Ju-jutsu. Spinning kicks to the face? Come on. This is suppose to be somewhat realistic. The ""Gun-Fu"" is now boring and is so over done. The action is a pale imitation of the previous movies.

The plot is ridiculous...without going into particulars it's just so silly.

And although Reeves says about 15 words in 3 hours, his acting is so bad, it's hard to hear those 15 words.

I realize this is all from the comic. But only a 12 year old would like this movie.",4
JohnDeSando,"""You'll run out of bullets before they run out of heads."" Winston (Ian McShane with ascot)

For John Wick: Chapter IV, the heads keep rolling, mostly decommissioned by the titular assassin's preternaturally accurate gun, and partly because it seems everyone now wears a bulletproof jacket often used as a shield. Hence the efficiency and necessity of one or two shots to the cranium. And very little blood, which I don't miss at all, given that, like sex, I don't need more than a glance to get it.

As with most cinema, even impossibly successful runs like this thriller juggernaut, it's about storytelling even when it's about beautifully-choreographed fight sequences that mix martial arts with high-end weaponry that includes a ""dragon's breath shotgun""! The story is as old as movies themselves: global corporate hoodlums, The Table, are after assassin John Wick, a wicked former employee. The rep is the smarmy Marguis (Bill Skarsgard), decked out in three-piece suits, the brighter the better, and cravats louder than Winston's (thank you costume designer Paco Delgado).

Wait till you see the wild-ass fight on a lengthy set of Parisian stairs or sit across from Killa (Scott Adkins, a martial arts expert), an almost sumo-sized card dealer. His silver teeth take us back to a memorable menace in the James Bond canon.

It's all very stylish, no doubt because of returning director Chad Stahelski's penchant for colorful neo-noir and writers Shay Hatten and Michael Finch's ability to take the fantasy into new/old motifs such as a duel that Clint Eastwood would approve. They also supply lines like ""Second chances are the refuge of men who fail"" in a film where memorable dialogue is not what the audience expected.

Who would expect set pieces such as combat in the Louvre and around the Arc de Triumph? Or better, who has a budget to afford those glories? Well, the producer of one of the most lucrative crime thriller series in cinema history that takes us to Germany, Japan, and France with ease.

I can't predict if Keanu Reeves will return, he with a fortune now probably greater than Croesus' (I hear Reeves is generous with his wealth), because one of the great lines from John's Japanese friend, Shimazu ( Hiroyuki Sanada), in this murderous ballet is ""Have you given any thought to how this ends?""

I have, and I hope it returns if it has more of the absurd style and beautiful ballet peppered with dialogue as sharp as the swords that dispatch very sharp baddies. John Wick: Chapter IV is as good as the best action films we will see all summer, and that bountiful crop has yet to start. Stay tuned.",N/A
terrylarosa,"The Wick films now have something in common with another popular franchise; the Road Runner cartoons. Wick is now more invulnerable than Wolverine. Last movie they dropped him off of a building. In this one they do the same but why stop there; they drop him off two buildings with nary a scratch. Wick just gets up and keeps on killing. Who cares right? Certainly not reviewers and critics who are giving this cartoonish movie high praise. But why stop there? Let's let him get hit by no less than 4 moving cars that would have shattered bones in a mere mortal. But let's go for more. Let's drop him not once but twice down hundreds of stairs only for him to get up and kill dozens more. My wife ( having loved the first 3 ) was thoroughly disgusted with this movie and I was quite dismayed myself. Wick peaked in the second brilliant one but they turned this into a stupid Fast and Furious movie defying what punishment a body can take. Wick is not hurt once except in the final gun battle. The movie gets a few stars for the cinematography, stunts and the great first big action action scene in Japan with the equally great Hiroyoki Sanada. Sadly the movie goes downhill from there. Watch for cartoon fun only.",6
thom59,"There are many deaths in this filmic free-for-all. And assassins. Donnie Yen plays a blind martial arts expert, a role he knows all too well since he played an identical character in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. And that really sets up the debate around whether plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, or just a dumb, lazy rip off. There are references aplenty from the sci-fi/kung fu genres, including some of Keanu's own efforts. He knows kung fu-and shows us. It's kung fu'd up the wazoo. I imagine the director, a stunt man himself, simply Scotch taped together one fight scene after the next. FOR THREE HOURS! Three writers are credited with crafting 380 words of dialogue for Mr. Reeves. Okay, I read that Stahelski and Reeves stripped out roughly half the dialogue written for his character in the initial script. Accordingly, I would have stripped the writers of their entire salary. The first instalment featuring this legendary hit-man was just that, a smash hit. However, much like the Matrix sequels John Wick: Chapter 4 just gets on my wick.

Incidentally, the movie tagline is Baba Yaga. More appropriate would be jibber-jabber. (193 words, where's my check?)",2
A7medSalah,"As thrilling and relentless as any action movie before it, John Wick: Chapter 4 is an adrenaline injection with Oscar worthy stunt work, assured direction and Keanu Reeves as magnetic as ever. The best Chapter yet...

John Wick: Chapter 4 feels like a film where Director Chad Stahelski understood that he finally had the freedom and the budget to do, literally, anything he wanted on the screen-and might never again-so by God, he was going to do it.

With characters able to dodge bullets left, right and centre, the film is a homage to the classic martial-arts genre with a sprinkling of old Hollywood Westerns where protagonists never seem to run out of ammunition or ways to stay alive.

The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsg√•rd plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.

Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.

Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years. It delivers more of what fans love about this series: stunning action sequences, cool visuals, charismatic performances, and intriguing lore. It also leaves room for more potential stories in this universe.",9
ltlinh-33044,"I loved the first 3 movies of the series, so I had high expectations when Chapter 4 came out. And I was so disappointed.

The movie is so drawn out and it's just doesn't make sense to me - there wasn't any clear intention for any character's actions - like why Nobody and Caine kept changing his mind over whether he should kill Wick or not? The killing over time just became repetitive - Wick just got away with many falls and attacked with virtually no harm at all. Many many more plot holes made this movie a pain to watch.

And then I read that Chapter 4 is the only movie not written by the original screenwriter. And then it made all the sense in the world.",4
musings-morsels,"I completely understand the hype, we don't get too many amazing choreographed fights with really clear camera work in movies anymore these days. Donnie Yen and Rina Sawayama's fights were just wow. And some of the shots, although ridiculous, did look beautiful (I'm talking about the club scene where people were still dancing, while the dude next them got axed in the face or Wick doing doughnuts around a bunch of cars with endless bullets), looks great and cool and aesthetically pleasing but after a while, it does make you roll your eyes.

It's becoming too outrageous that it's laughable now, getting closer to the fast and furious franchise, which is a shame. When it's so silly, you become less invested in the characters it makes the long ass fight scenes just plain boring. Where it lost points for me is; 1 for the plot, 1 for the dialogue , 1 for Keanu's acting and 1 for the sheer silliness of it all. It really took me out of the moment which made me feel every minute of the 3 hrs run time.",6

Surly he got of go there easier ? The overlay of the radio DJ at the end was annoying,how did she know where he wa aging to be constantly??",7
lonestaradvent,"I'm quite baffled at how good this movie was rated. I'm certain it is mostly the crew and their family/friends that upvoted this garbage.

What was wrong with this film:

Plot: the plot, like in most action films, is paper thin. Like most other reviewers have stated, you forget why he's doing what he's doing. This film had NOTHING to do with the first three, which is part of the reason of the success of the franchise. Nothing from the 3rd film was answered in this 4th rendition. What happend with Winston and Keanu from JW3? Why was nothing talked about. It's almost like writers retconned that whole scenario and it detracted from the movie. In the beginning of the film, JW kills the guy who heads the table. Kinda pointless, this should've been the climax of the film.

The rest of the plot involved him going to random places to do random things, with action embodying the pacing throughout the film. His motivation was non-existent. If this was supposed to be the final film, why didn't Wick go after the bosses that have spots in the High Table? Why was he chasing after, or getting chased after by, the Marquis. The guy was a small fry compared to the High Table.

The comedy was terrible as was the delivery. I was confounded in the theatre when people laughed at the ""dog bites nuts"" bit. We saw that JW3 with better taste.

Acting/Characters: The acting is legit garbage. From Neo to Morpheus. It was over the top, and it looked like Neo learned his lines that day. Keanu's delivery was painful to witness. I was embarrassed I paid for the premium seating to watch this movie. Winston and Morpheus didn't care about this film and it showed. They would say a few lines then poof, disappear from the movie. This killed what little pacing the movie displayed outside of the action scenes.

Although the film tried to make you care about the new comers, it failed miserably. There was no character development, just bits and pieces of information for the viewer to piece together to understand why they were placed in the film. The guy with the dog was a pointless addition. The antagonist was pointless as well.

The blind warrior has been done to death, and JW4 defiled the grave. We don't care about him because he's a pointless addition to the movie to showcase ""eastern"" style fighting. He offers nothing to the plot. We don't care about his backstory, but we're forced to view it, because it's apparent he and that hot Japanese chick will be back in the 5th movie or the series.

The Action: it was comical and sad. Keanu just can't do what he did 3 or 4 years ago and it shows with every fight scene he's in. If you actually paid attention to the moves that the other actors performed while fighting with Keanu, you can see where they wait for him to perform his set, and join the dance accordingly. It was painful to watch Keanu try to do the outlandish moves that he performed in the first 3 entries of this series. Every time he was in a fight scene, his sluggish movements just took me out of the movie and made me impatient.

The Setting: Part of the success of this franchise is how the setting was ever widening with each new movie. The first movie we got a glimpse of his time with the Russian Mafia. The second movie we see there is an intricate web of different crime bosses that have formed a collective of control on a world wide scale. The third movie furthered this notion of world wide control as John seeks the man above the table to redeem his life.

The fourth movie did nothing to help evolve the setting. Sure we see a lot of nice prints of different locations, but what does that have to do with the overall arc of the franchise? Nothing. We're taken to different locations for arbitrary reasons and the director expects the audience to oh and ah over the cinematography.

The Realism: Going into an action film, I think we, as an audience, understand that reality is loosely based. This film took it to another level. The director and writers rip us out of the movie when John falls 4 stories and walks it off, gets hit by 5 cars going at least 30+ mph and gets up to dust off his coat, and falls down over 200+ STONE stairs and cracks his back to start his ascend in the final act.

What Hollywood doesn't realize is that in order for this kind of fantasy to work, it has to be within a certain genre of film or literature. Just like I wouldn't want to see Harry Potter doing some Calc problems, because magical fantasy ya know? I expect John to be hurt at some point when surviving bone shattering and organ expoding injuries.

Overall, this film sucked from start to finish. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either: Someone who worked on the film, a family/friend, a cringe fanboi, or someone who worships Keanu cuz he's a nice guy irl.",1
jon_hsieh,"Im more of a story/plot type of audience and this was just action packed, throw the storyline right out the window type of movie.

Action junkies...this ones for YOU!

At any rate, this was absolutely horrible writing. For the last 3 Wicks, every decision just brought him back to square one. Its an endless loop. A writers nightmare when you dont have a story that progresses.

Where this really shines is the cinematography, and fight choreography. Stunning work by the everyone on the crew. Pretty amazing the type shots they were able to get in and had some really good one shots. The fights scenes are awesome but just kinda got old when the movie is nearly 3 hours long.

Entertaining film... would def say it was worth the money.",5
jit-23697,"Love love John wick films but I think the director has been watching too many bollywood films, was sick and tired of all the fighting. Reminded me of all the bollywood films I've watched where they never die even when they're shot and after being stabbed repeatedly. This film could have been made in 1.5 hours or so where I would have enjoyed it more. Thank god I didn't pay to go to a cinema. Kept waiting for dual but of course had to kill a 101 people before it happened. Please don't make any more John wick films they are getting boring and no excitement. Overall the film from start to finish was a waste of my time, probably enjoyed 1/2 hour or so.",4
Oh_Capital,"This is a classic case of style over substance. The settings and cinematography were pleasing to the eye, and the fight scenes were choreographed better than 90% of the other action flicks out there. The problem is I never cared about what was going on, who was dying, and how it was all gonna turn out for Baba Yaga.

John definitely killed more men then words he said. It was mostly grunts and a couple of classic Keanu lines like ""I have to get back,"" monotone half sentences. But I suppose that is part of his charm. The point is the dialogue was terrible.

I understand it's not an emotional drama so dialogue and plot are not at the top of the list, but could we not have gotten some decent story telling? It's just fight scene to fight scene. Oh well, John Wick is a fun time at the theater with your buddies and a couple of drinks, but be prepared to endure 3 hours of one big fight scene.",5
adhipar,"This movie has the same plot as before: John Wick against the rest of the assassin world with longer running time. What is good with a longer duration is the characters can be well developed, and I really like that Donnie Yen, Shamir Anderson, Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins have enough time to show their acting. Especially Donnie and Scott. Hiroyuki/Henry Sanada has seriously acted on several movies so he's natural.

Another benefit with longer duration is of course more actions! However, I'm a bit dissapointed about this, because it doesn't mean that to make it longer, those henchmen should be too hard too kill as if they were zombies which you need to punch, kick, throw, shot on the knee, leg, abdomen, chest and finally their head to finally died. For those troops with full body armor (in Continental hotel set) this is still logical. But for those thugs in Paris who were not use a bulletproof suits, this become silly. I don't understand why John Wick didnt try to break their neck or shot their heads to quickly eliminate them.

Not only those thugs are zombies, John Wick should also a zombie since he fell from 2nd/3rd floor several times, get stabbed, punched kicked, hit by car also several time, fall down and roll over on hundreds of steps and still can get up and seems fine.

And I totally loss it when there's a shooting duel, with one of the participant is blind!. I really want the movie to be finished asap.

However, as I said, the character development is nice and the gun-fu which are shot from above from room to room is also memorable. I quite enjoyed them. 7/10.",7
nakrugt,"The stunt-work is amazing, let's start with that.

Editing is quite nice. So is photography. Acting is not much needed in the movie. At least, acting is not needed as much as stunts. I mean, the action scenes are - how can I put this delicately - impossible or borderline fantasy level unless the whole film is in The Matrix, and also the third film, of course.

The character development does not exist, physics does not defy John Wick ever. The opposite cannot be said, though.

Even if you turn off your brain and watch, most of it does not make sense, at all.

However, if you are into mindless, illogical action scenes, John Wick is the film for you.

One more thing, in a gun fight, if you lose to a guy who cannot see, in brightly lit environments, maybe you should give up your career as an assassin. If not, you deserve to get killed in ""action"". One intriguing character was Mr. Nobody, unfortunately, though, the writers bestowed upon him the part of Martha (Batman vs Superman) in this movie.",2
j-sporrer,"The story was ok but could have been better flushed out. Fight scenes are great but they were way too long and so unrealistic. Not nearly as good as the other 3 movies. If they would have given us a little more background on some of the new characters it would have made more sense and given them more depth. In previous movies John would use his Krav Magra skills to take down or slow down someone then a double tap to the head would usually be sufficient. Those fight scenes were outstanding and believable. Almost all of fights in this movie ridiculous. People were shot and stabbed several times and looked like they weren't hurt. How many times did John get hit by a car and just walked away? How many times do you have to hit someone in the face with nunchucks before they go down. I used to think John was special. The Baba Yaga. But in this version he is made to look almost invincible. Really, did they have to get so far away from reality this time. I left somewhat disappointed. Was I watching a movie or a video game?",6

Serial killer John Wick is at it again, folks. They should have a graphic in the top right corner of the screen counting how many people he kills in every movie. If watching this doesn't make your brain hurt, you may need to get yours fixed.

There can be zero tension in an action movie when there is this much carnage going on. If the hero always comes through, no matter how daunting the odds are against him, why bother watching? Just fast-forward to the end, or stand up and walk out of the theater.",1

danielcereto,"John Wick first movie was an authentic masterpiece. Action was pretty well executed, even credible, thanks to Mr Keanu Reeves work and an interesting script and great choreographies. So consequently, I was pretty excited about the 4th statement. Same director, Keanu, and one of my favorite martial arts actors: Mr Donnie Yen (If you don't know who is him I recommend to watch IP man movies), simply amazing.

Anyway, what can go wrong with a great talented cast and a great director?... Almost everything.

First, the action scenes are extremely long and unreal, even sometimes boring because the repetition of them. You know nobody can't kill John, from the beginning because of his new Marvel's anti bullet suit... Really?

Second, the movie itself looks like a videogame or a superheroes movie. It has lost it's soul, any realistic or human scene. A shame. Watch the original again to know what I am talking about. To add, the script is inexistent. The most predictable one from the Saga.

Last, it's great to include animals but sometimes it's embarrassing to watch several ultra unreal situations. I really love animals but stop making them superheroes, (watched Sisu too this week).

So, overall, is it a bad movie? Not it's not. It's the just the John Weak's of the saga. Best again are the filmography, music and direction. Beautiful but empty.",5
aarongnr,"This is a tough one. Not only to review, but also to watch. Never before have I seen a movie where the opponents are so obviously taking turns attacking. There are countless scenes in this movie where John Wick is fighting multiple opponents and every one except the one he is currently fighting is dancing around awkwardly in the background until its their turn to attack. It's infuriating. And it happens constantly throughout the movie.

Now, not everything about the action is bad. Some of the fight scenes are awesome, mostly the ones where he is fighting someone one on one.

The camera work, scenery, set design are all beautiful. Even the story of this installment is better than what we had previously. The movie also introduces a couple of fantastic new characters and the conclusion is quite satisfying.

All that to be completely underminded by the truly atrocious fight choreographies throughout the movie. They made this an absolute chore to watch at times.",7

MrDHWong,"""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is the fourth film in the ""John Wick"" franchise. Once again directed by Chad Stahleski and starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, it stands out as not only the best film in the series but also as one of the very best action films made in recent decades.

Shortly after the events of the third film, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is in the planning stages of taking down the powerful High Table once and for all. After executing the Elder (George Georgiou), a man ranked above the High Table, John travels to Osaka to seek refuge in their local Continental Hotel. While there, John learns from the manager that his old blind friend Caine (Donnie Yen) and a bounty hunter known only as ""Mr. Nobody"" (Shamier Anderson) have each been ordered to assassinate him by a High Table member named Marquis Vincent de Gramont (Bill Skarsg√•rd). As he fights off various other assassins, John eventually meets up with New York's Continental manager Winston Scott (Ian McShane), who may hold the key to disbanding the High Table permanently.

Almost a decade since its debut, the ""John Wick"" series has cemented itself as one of the most popular action film franchises to ever grace movie theatres. The films are known for their highly stylised action scenes, memorable supporting characters, and intriguing world building elements that always make audiences come back for more. At the centre of it all is of course Keanu Reeves, who has helped the titular character become one of the most recognisable action heroes of all time. Now four films in, you would expect the series to show signs of losing some steam but ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" proves all doubters wrong with an exhilarating action-packed experience that leaves other similar films in the dust.

Now that he's ""excommunicado"", the stakes are at an all time high as we see John facing off against even more dangerous adversaries than before. Anybody who's watched these films since the beginning will know that John's worldwide infamy makes it increasingly difficult for him to find allies willing to assist, especially considering how the bounty on his head keeps rising with every powerful enemy he makes. Because of that, there's more tension this time around than in previous entries, allowing less room for error at the risk of sudden death. Most of the time, John relies solely on his own wit and ingenuity to take out his enemies, whether it's with his simple handgun or with any part of the surrounding environment. John is a resourceful assassin, not blinding shooting at any moving target but instead calculating the right time and technique to take out a particular foe, no matter how minor. It is this trait that separates a character like John Wick from the rest of the typical action heroes, as contemplating his next move is what has made him so interesting to watch over the past four films.

Something else I've admired about ""John Wick"" series is the attention-to-detail that goes into virtually every scene. Regardless of where things are taking place, there's so much visual beauty and creativity on display in each shot. This film is certainly no exception as it contains some truly breathtaking cinematography that places the audience right at the forefront of the action. If these scenes don't rejuvenate you, then you probably have no pulse. From the brightly coloured neon lights of Osaka to the raving nightlife of Berlin, every location oozes so much personality that they almost become characters in their own right. It is in these places that some of the best choreographed, best edited, and best filmed fight scenes in recent memory are able to firmly establish this fourth entry as one of the most exciting action films to ever be released in theatres. Yet despite all the frenetic shoot-outs and hand-to-hand combat, they are all handled with such careful precision that it is still easy to follow everything happening without losing focus of who is fighting who. And to top it all off, at no point is shaky cam ever used during the action scenes, which makes these already entertaining segments even better.

For someone approaching his 60s, Keanu Reeves shows absolutely no signs of slowing down in the iconic lead role. Every shot that he fires, every punch that he throws, and every sword that he swings proves that Reeves can still hold his own alongside any younger cast members. There were even times where I couldn't help but notice some of the other supporting cast struggling to keep up with Reeves, which helped make him stand out quite considerably. Although the character of John Wick has never really had a huge amount of depth behind him, he definitely has a level of intrigue, something I think Reeves is able to play into perfectly. He is man of few words, whose widespread notoriety and respect from other assassins combined with his compassion for the defenseless makes him an endearing hero for the audience to cheer for. After all, it's easy to care about somebody who has risked everything to avenge the death of his dog.

Additionally, I don't think the film would have worked half as well without John's two worthy opponents - Donnie Yen as Caine and Shamier Anderson as Mr. Nobody. Yen's depiction of Caine draws comparisons to that of Marvel's Daredevil, in that he is blind but a highly skilled martial artist relying on his other senses to defeat enemies. Caine's proficiency in combat is so unparalleled that each time I saw him fight I kept forgetting about his blindness since his reflexes are so unusually fast. However, what I liked most was the mutual respect between him and John, being that they were once close friends in the past. On the other hand, Mr. Nobody is completely different as he has no personal connection to John. He is only doing this job for the money but along the way he learns that John is a force to be reckoned with. It is interesting to watch how Mr. Nobody learns more about John as the film progresses, and Anderson successfully brings out all the necessary layers of curiosity surrounding his character.

Even after four movies, the ""John Wick"" series is still as impactful as it was when it first started, with each film being better than the last. What began as a relatively straightforward story of a man seeking revenge against those who killed his dog is now a multi-layered, action-packed, and beautifully shot set of films that exists within its own meticulously crafted world. This fourth film has not only helped redefine the series as a whole but also what action movies are capable of in general. Personally, I would love to see another ""John Wick"" film but according to director Chad Stahleski, this will be the last one for a while with the spin-off film ""Ballerina"" and miniseries ""The Continental"" coming soon to fill the void in the meantime. Either way, it looks like this series is here to stay.

I rate it a solid 9/10.",9
jyefu,"One of the most tedious, overly long drawn out self aggrandising pieces of drivel I have ever had the misfortune to sit through.

Constant repetition during fight scenes that add nothing the whole film could've been just over an hour long and would've been much better because of it.

I really really loved the first three films that this is the chapter four that they thought we wanted is unreal.

And such miss use of Lance Reddick in one of his last ever roles.

The only good thing to come out of this film is, I don't think there be any more of them.

They should have called it, John Wick and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.",1
Boristhemoggy,"I remember watching the Matrix series films and thinking the sheer silly volume of attackers all at once, and yet Neo manages to overcome them all. Some of the scenes were well choreographed, but by Matrix 3 I was fast forwarding through scenes as it was the same blocking, throwing, shooting of people repeated over and over. It got to the point where it was overkill if you'll pardon the pun.

With John Wick 3 I said the same thing. There's one thing being John Rambo, but at least it was believable, at a stretch.

Neo and John Wick are both unbelievable and frankly beginning to be boring. They're all just the same.

I watched this one as I hoped for something a bit better but all it is is violence, errors, continuity problems and ridiculous scenarios.

It's mildly entertaining I think because the acting is mostly OK and production values are high. But as an action film it leaves an awful lot to be desired.",6
Snownoise,"I wasn't interested in watching this movie because I knew what I'm going to get, but my friend told me that we've watched Chapter 3, and we've come this far, so we might as well just watch chapter 4. The result was just as I expected. It was just the same as Bullet train and other movies produced from the same production. Just another typical villains and typical fight scenes over and over. This John Wick production team or ""franchise"" has transitioned into a new Fast and Furious franchise making the same movies again and again by replacing cars and gimmicks. If they pivot and make some turns to adapt new ingredients that we've tasted from the first John Wick movie, then it would be still enjoyable, but it's too late to stop this ""cliche train"" starting from John Wick chapter 3, Nobody, Bullet Train, Violent night, and this John Wick: Chapter 4. I don't think this franchise will die any time soon. They are probably working another movies in John Wick universe right now.",1
taz1004,"Yes I know what the franchise is about. I don't expect realism from John Wick movie. But some things are just outright ridiculous. How is it that their suits deflect bullets but they get hurt so bad by nunchuck? Don't tell me it's because they're hit on the head. They were hit on the arm and the back and still got hurt more than gunshots. I'm assuming that's supposed to be comedy? I wasn't sure as it wasn't clear.

In 2nd or 3rd one they said once the ticket is torn, there's no way back but now it turns out it's really easy to get back? Just had to kill a guy? I liked the first John Wick because the story was simple. But now the story is just stupid.

I guess the appeal is all the action scenes but they're soooo repetitive that it really gets boring. Especially if you watch all 4 in a row. No, I didn't binge all 4 in a row but watched 1 per weekend because my daughter didn't see the first 3 and wanted to watch the 4th. And it was still too repetitive that by the 3rd movie, I was ready to skip them.",3
waltermwilliams,"More talk of High Tables blah, blah, blah let's get on with the action!

There is plenty of that in ""John Wick: Chapter 4"".

This was only meant to be a trilogy, but who can argue a 4th chapter when your franchise is a license to print money?

Keanu Reeves is back as John Wick of course and even shares what eulogy he'd like on his tombstone when and if that day comes.

Also accompanying him is Ian McShane as ""Winston"" The Manger of the Continental Hotel. That sliver in New York.

Its concierge is still Lance Reddick as ""Charon"".

The wonderful actor and voice actor who died recently at age 60, which makes his appearance even sadder.

The villain of this instalment is one of modern cinemas finest, Bill Skarsgard as ""Marquis"".

If you loved him as ""Pennywise"" in ""IT"" just wait to see if the balloons all float down here too in Wickland.

Hiroyuki Sanada is a fine actor who heads up the Osaka Hotel in Japan as ""Shimazu"" where some of the best action takes place.

Plus of course Lawrence Fishburne as the ""Bowery King"" and tailor to Johnathon...especially the 42 regular Kevlar suit.

Donnie Yen is back as ""Caine"".

Proving even a blind man can tell when he's walking in the Sun or shooting bad guys using door bells.

Shamier Anderson is ""The Tracker"" or ""Mr Nobody"" who with the help of his faithful killer dog takes care of business as a gun for hire.

Clancy Brown with his marvellous bass/baritone voice is ""The Harbinger"" of mostly bad news.

One unbelievable death defying fight scene after another plays out during the longest ""John Wick"" chapter ever at 2hrs 49 minutes...especially considering this movie was designed to be seen on IMAX screens where times should be much shorter.

Watch out for: The Arc de Triomphe car chase battle scene and the 200 plus stairs fight.

The sound engineering is first class with a great soundtrack.

You simply have to throw logic out the door to fully comprehend what's happening on the big screen and just enjoy the ride.

It's a thriller and possibly one of the best in this saga that started in 2014.

Maybe ""John Wicks"" farewell tour is finally coming to an end.

Keanu at 59 is still being excellent to his mates and proving deadly to his enemies, but even Wick can't kill everyone.",7
hectordanielbuelna,"After the pleasant success John Wick was, the creators somehow managed to made their magnum opus John Wick 2, the best one by far, where the whole idea of the unstoppable legendary assassin gets fully realized.

In this movie, however, just like in the last one they tried making the action more bombastic by giving the villain ""all the power in the world"", not only overcomplicating the whole lore of the assasins guilt (once again) but also turning the whole action of the movie into a cartoonish mess.

Once again the Baba Yaga gets turned into a damage sponge who keeps just walking off been thrown off high buildings, getting run over, punched and hit with multiple objects and still winning every fight by the power of deus ex machina.

The pacing of the action is just horrible, every 5 minutes there's a random fight and Wick keeps barely making it out alive but they keep expecting you take this crap seriously! Forget how awesome and practical gun-fu was in the first film, this time everyone has magical bullet proof clothing that just makes the fights longer and the whole choreography less believable.

There are a couple of great cinematic and tense scenes (I specifically loved the sword fight NOT involving Wick and the scene where the camera is on the ceiling inside the abandoned building). Sadly there's a ton of things I hated: the almos 3 hour duration, the whole retcon and rush to stablish a new villain, the weak motivations gor said villain, the blind guy with superpowers, the needless ""tracker"" guy and his dog, the amount of random and long fighting scenes that just kept going and kept happening... So bad.",2
spotboyfilms,"Parabellum (part 3) was my favorite and as is the case in many sequels, hard to keep topping your last go- not in the case of the John Wick team. They keep figuring out ways to keep the story interesting, delivering on the action set pieces and adding to the lore in a very effective and stylish way. John Wick 4 was an absolute pleasure to watch. It was full of entertainment. Despite being almost 3 hours long, it does not have boring sections. The non-action scenes have interesting characters, drama and incredible production design. John Wick continues to raise its own bar. As in the previous entries, each action set piece is distinguished and powerful. This is one of those movies that must be watched on the big screen.",10
AO8,"Was very excited for this movie. Watched the other 3 and thoroughly enjoyed them. However, this one was just okay if not bad? Idk if im getting older (in my late 20's now) and maybe these type of movies just don't entertain me as much they used to, but the fighting scenes were boring. I could see the ""WWE"" in it, and the exaggerated acting of the henchmen. Even with that, i was okay but the exact moment where I just lost interest was the fighting scene in the ""dance club"". You have john fighting and him hacking a guy in the head with an axe, shooting and then even being dragged up the stairs by his tie and the random partying civilians around just....stared and kept dancing? No running or screaming? Wtf? Like even a meth head would run at that sight...Like I get it's not supposed to be absolutely real, i mean tbey have bullet proof suits but. C'mon.",5
nscoby93,"John Wick: Chapter 4 as with the past three films continues to develop its world, its characters, goes bigger with the amazing action set pieces, and amazing fight chrography.

One of my biggest concerns going into this film was its run time as I have felt the John Wick movies do not garner a two plus hour film so if they want to do a movie that's damn near three hours then the story needed to deliver...

And I am very happy to say they delivered with great storytelling.

The film did not start as fast as I anticipated it would but instead opened up establishing new characters and its story. In fact John was barely in the first half hour of the movie which I was surprised by but it was a very welcome change of pace.

The action sequences are bigger and better than we have ever seen before, they've always managed to top themselves movie to movie and Chapter 4 is no different.

But the absolute standout action sequence for me is in this abandoned French home in the third act of the film. It was fantastically choreographed, and the camera work was phenomenal and truly unique. Whatever the camera crew is making its not enough.

Some certain issues for me, where as I didn't feel the run time for the most part I did begin to feel fatigue during an action sequence in the third act. It felt prolonged to me and I just wanted to move forward with things. But the movie never felt to have dragged and was entertaining and engaging through its entire run time.

Lastly I would like to say some words about the recently passed Lance Riddick. While his character Charon was small, his impact was anything but small. The John Wick world, and The Continental Hotel will not be the same without it's courteous and always professional concierge, he will be missed! As Winston said...

""He was a friend""

If this is the final Chapter in the John Wick storyline then I am very pleased with its conclusion but as I mentioned there's plenty of opportunity for more in this world.

wargamesjoshua,"The entire plot of this movie was utterly meaningless. John Wick accomplishes absolutely nothing aside from getting all of his friends killed in his efforts to get away from the High Table, and all that sacrifice was meaningless in the end. From the way that the characters kept claiming that you can't change your nature, and how nothing meaningful changed in the end, I can only conclude that the pointlessness was the point.

Should we try to better ourselves? No, says this movie. Should we try to better the world? No, you can't do that claims this movie.

People, this movie claims, are nothing more than idiotic sheep that will just keep doing what they are doing, even as people are being brutally murdered right before their eyes. I remembered enjoying the first movie, but giving money to this disgusting piece of propaganda was a mistake.",1
omarosman-27702,The first John Wick movie made something really special. They introduce us a semi-realistic action movie as a genre. Unfortunately they set the bar too high and with every movie things have gotten worse. I am deeply sorry to watch this movie to get Marvelised. A frickin blind dude who just happens to see everything? The staircase scene? Are you kidding me? Yeah yeah we are about to kill each other but first let me save your dog from the bad guys? Lets just make the dog pee over the bad dudes corpse with cheesey one liner? It had some great scenes but at this point this isnt a John Wick movie. It is like a bad parody of it from Marvel.,1
grichman,"Sure, I was pumped up to see this movie on opening day, but it did not end that way.

Nothing new came to the table. It took too long to get moving, and when it did, all the fight scenes kinda merged together and the absolute lack of plot took over. So, you end with hundreds of people fighting in one building. Nothing new and exciting. I should have just rewatched the older ones.

I like the 'kill as many villains as possible' genre, but for 20 minutes straight, a bunch of bad guys were all killed in the same fashion. The movie was loud for the sake of being loud. I would bring earplugs.

The acting does not really exist; The plot does not really exist. The movie became a lacuna of what it could have been. It's a grand stinker.

I walked out after one hour, picked up some disgusting Panda Express from the mall, and got home early.",3
zbindend,"I'm really struggling to understand why this movie was rated so good. It is insanely ridiculous. Unbelievably unrealistic. Bad script. Almost three hours with way too long (even boring) fighting scenes. I must have seen something different than all the others. Keanu Reeves was maybe talking 30 lines in almost three hours. Or at least that's how it feels. 1 and 2 was ok. On one point I thought I'm back on matrix. Always additional opponents showing up - but of course always just two at a time and in the same order - two masked ones, two in suits, and then starting again with two masked ones etc. What a pity.

There is only one nice thing - even though you could consider it as a bit too much: Camera and light were really great.",5
kosmasp,"No pun intended - and that feeling can be many things. While I still see Keanu from the Bill and Ted franchise .. the way he talks and how he ""acts"" ... well if you've seen it once, you can't unsee it. That said, it does not take away anything from the action extravaganza that is going on in this. Actually that makes me want to revisit the other Wick movies and maybe re-rate them. Giving them a higher score.

Also I have to admit, that even though Denzel is the better actor (no secret here), franchise wise Wick has totally obliterated the Equalizer franchise ... kind of like he obliterates his enemies as Wick. You may wonder why they even try .. I guess for our amusement. For those who are able to stomache all the violence that is of course.

I did watch this on an Imax screen and let me tell you: violence never looked better. But also everything else. Be it dawn, sunrise and everything in between. There are many scenes and there are some quotes that should be inspirational too. Friendship means little when it's convenient ... that is some deep ... stuff right there.

I don't think that the movie gives the viewer too many riddles when it comes to guessing where it all leads to. You also should not mind the fact that Keanu or rather Wick must have a bionic body ... or his suit actually is made of a material that shields his body ... well one or the other ... or you just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. It makes as much sense as driving cars into space (yes looking at you Fast and Furious franchise) ... but we do not watch these movies for logic and rhyme and reason. I'd hope the same applies to you.

There are some really great visual stunts in Paris - and it looks like they shot them there. But CGI is so far ahead ... who really knows? It does look awesome though. And towards the end ... the action inside a house and the way it is shot ... the director is coming up with new stuff all the time.

And for the first time ever (in a John Wick movie), there is an after credit scene ... so sit down and wait for it - even if it may not be entirely satisfactory ... then again, until the next one comes out (it surely must be announced soon, no matter how this ended), the ending here is also ... well you may not be entirely happy with it ... but happy is a word that is missing in Wicks dictionary anyway ... so there we go.

Edit: I don't do pointers when I write reviews which leads to me forgetting stuff. Lance Reddick who recently passed away and will be missed, was obviously an integral part of the franchise. Many may know him from TV shows, such as Fringe, The Wire and many more. But apart from him and many recurring characters (those who survive that is), we get many Newcomers. Bill Skarsgard being the top villain - and he does a great accent! As does Scott Adkins - ja! And of course the excellent as always Donnie Yen! The action (choreography) is the star - but it doesn't hurt to have some great people in front of the camera too.",9
rexmatthewj,"""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is a thrilling and satisfying fourth installment and continuation of the popular neo-noir action franchise ""John Wick."" The film delivers on its promises of high-octane action, stunning visuals, and compelling characters, starring Keanu Reeves as the titular assassin seeking vengeance against those who wronged him. The film follows John Wick (Keanu Reeves) as he seeks revenge against the High Table, a mysterious organization that rules over the world of assassins. Along the way, John Wick encounters old friends and foes, such as Caine (Donnie Yen), a blind former colleague forced to hunt him down; Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada), a hotel manager who offers him sanctuary; and Chidi (Marko Zaror), a ruthless enforcer who works for the Marquis (Bill Skarsg√•rd), a senior member of the High Table. ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is directed by Chad Stahelski, who also helmed the previous three films, and written by Shay Hatten, Michael Finch, and Derek Kolstad.

The film is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has helmed all previous John Wick films, and written by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch. The script is tight and well-paced, balancing exposition with action and humor. The dialogue is witty and memorable, with some nods to previous films and pop culture references.

""The film delivers on its promise of non-stop action and thrilling stunts that showcase Reeves' physical prowess and dedication. The fight scenes are well choreographed with precision and creativity, and Reeves performs most of his own stunts featuring a variety of weapons and styles such as nunchucks, Judo, and jujitsu. The fight scenes are inventive and brutal, ranging from hand-to-hand combat to gunfights to car chases, among others. The cinematography by Dan Laustsen captures the gritty and stylish aesthetic of the franchise, while the music by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard adds to the adrenaline rush and enhances the mood and tension of each scene.""

""The film boasts a stellar cast, led by Reeves in his role as John Wick, who embodies his character with charisma and intensity, conveying emotions through his eyes and body language. Reeves' credibility as an action star is further established by his own stunt performances. Yen is a welcome addition to the franchise as Caine, with whom John shares a complex relationship. Yen showcases both his martial arts skills and acting chops in several scenes with Reeves. Skarsg√•rd is menacing as the Marquis de Gramont, one of John's main antagonists, bringing sophistication and cruelty to his role. Additionally, Sanada, Anderson, Sawayama, Adkins, McShane, Fishburne, Reddick, Brown, Georgiou, Zaror, and Tena all deliver solid performances in their respective roles.""

The film's only flaw is that it may be too violent for some viewers . The film does not shy away from showing bloodshed and gore , which may be disturbing or off-putting for some . The film also has some scenes that may be considered unrealistic or implausible , such as John surviving multiple injuries or escaping certain situations . However , these are minor issues that do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the film .

Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) provides an entertaining and thrilling experience for fans of action movies and admirers of Keanu Reeves' charisma. The film offers plenty of adrenaline-pumping action sequences that showcase Reeves' prowess as an action star. John Wick: Chapter 4 is a must-watch for fans of the franchise and action lovers alike . It is one of the best films of 2023 , With its nonstop action and outstanding performances by the cast, John Wick: Chapter 4 is highly recommended and definitely worth watching.""",10

However, under the leadership of the arrogant and sadistic Marquis (Bill Skarsgard) a contract for $20M remains in place and the Marquis starts by seeking revenge on Winston for not killing Wick in JW3.

There are simply no other films like the JW films. Basically Wick moves from one impossible scenario to another beating up and killing what must be 100+ baddies in this film. The trick with all this is the stunning, balletic way these scenes are put together - they are just so incredibly and beautifully designed and almost hypnotic to watch - there is scene where you watch Wick move from room to room burning people up or shooting them and filmed from above - extraordinary. Wick is just the coolest character on screen since Frank Bullitt and he is well supported by Ian McShane, Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen and Skarsgard is a terrific bad guy.

The scene where he gets kicked down the stairs and just keeps flinging himself down all of them even though he could easily stop himself might just be one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in a movie.

The scenes with the ""blind"" guy who fights like he can obviously see is probably THE stupidest thing I've ever seen. It's really kind of a shame what this franchise devolved into.

dakotadickenson-83457,"I never thought I would say this, but it's rare when a film executes everything it can to be just as good or if not better than it's past films in a franchise and John Wick: Chapter 4 does that in every single way possible. While every film in this franchise has been absolutely great, John Wick: Chapter 4 has changed the action genre in films as we know it, bringing everything it could possibly give us to the franchise and more. This movie had action and stunts that I never thought could be possible until viewing this movie and it did not disappoint. After taking a hard hit and recovering from the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 Parabellum, Keanu Reeves returns once again as John Wick to take down any assassin that comes his way and put a end to the manhunt against him by challenging a lead member of the high table to a duel that will either earn him his freedom or could be the end of the Boogeyman. The antagonist in this film Marquis de Gramont played by Bill Skarsgard is absolutely menacing in this role, while bringing us not only a antagonist the franchise hasn't seen before, but also unlike any character Bill Skarsgard has played before. Out of all the newest cast members to come to this film, Donnie Yen was a absolute standout as Caine, a blind assassin and old acquaintance of John Wick's whose ordered by Marquis to hunt him down or suffer the consequences. Shimazu played by Hiroyuki Sanada I also thought was a great addition to the cast after seeing his performance in Bullet Train. The character I was not expecting to like that I thought was also a highlight of the film was Tracker played by Shamier Anderson. He was probably one of my favorite characters to come to the franchise and I hope we see him again in the John Wick Universe in the future. I was glad to see Lawrence Fishburne's Bowery King return as well as Ian McShane's Winston. I was also very happy to see Lance Reddick return one last time as Charon after his sudden passing right before the release of the film. He may of not have had a lot of screentime, but the last scene he was in I felt was closure for not only Lance Reddick, but his character as well. There is no doubt in my mind that this film will go down in history as one of the greatest action films of all time. John Wick: Chapter 4 is hands down one of the most action packed I've ever seen, while also being one of the best I've seen in a long time that was made carefully with the end result being one of the best action film to be released in the past decade.

The main audience for this type of movie are the same that pay to watch the Fast and Furious franchise.

This franchise needs to hire a younger actor, make the fight scenes a little more realistic and stop copying Power Rangers.

Where once Wick dodged damage by using his skills to not get hit (& we could genuinely see how he avoided it), now he just brushes off 'Superman' level damage (it's so ridiculous it gets genuinely annoying...from plummeting off buildings, to getting hit by multiple speeding cars, to smashing down 100's of stone steps) that makes EVERY fight pointless (who cares if he gets punched, when bone crushing falls literally do no damage)? Assassins suddenly either don't bother to shoot or punch him when they have a chance, or simply can't hit him even if when he's standing still! But who cares anyway right, when he's now seemingly made of Adamantium!?

. And why tediously rehash ""Rogue One"" by making #DonnieYen blind again? Worse, it just adds to the annoying stupidity. That a blind swordsman could hear his enemy move, or feel the air moving when a sword strikes, makes (a fantastical) sense. But how does a blind man dodge getting shot by multiple gunmen standing 20-30 feet away? Can he 'hear' the direction a gun is pointing? What utter nonsense. In fact he's so not effected by being blind...why make him blind?!

. There's also a sorry lack of links to the other 3 films. You could watch this & fully understand most of it. Bar Fishburne, Reddick & McShane no characters return & even the shocking betrayal by #IanMcShane in ""3"" (including shooting Wick off a building) is completely ignored by the plot AND Wick! He's just back to being a friend & ally again as if nothing happened. Hell, even the damn dog gets ignored!

. The fact is if ""3"" had a better final 3rd with a satisfying ending we would've had a truly great action franchise trilogy. As it is the entire bloated finale & garbage non-ending of ""3"" seemed to doom the franchise UNLESS a (money-grabbing) ""4"" could perform a miracle...But as we know, miracles rarely happen.

Best just stick with ""1"" then now.",3
attermail,"While this sequel brings so much fighting, the violence seems to lack the punch and credibility of those before it. The fight scenes often had moments where it felt slow, as if people were waiting to be punched. There's a scene where John fights and kills people in amongst ravers dancing and they just keep dancing like nothing is happening till the scene is about to change and the director shouts ""run"".

Understandably, the violence is all that is left for John, because he's being hunted - but the violence eventually becomes repetitive making the movie feel like it could be condensed to a trailer and you'd have a clear idea of what happened. It's also clear that to make up for an aging franchise we are gifted with beautifully detailed sets to help cover up slow scenes.",4
klindon-38400,I used to make fun of him. He talked like a surfer. He had little to no emotional stake in his performances. I could do a perfect impression of him. A dumb surfer who just happens to be in the right place at the right time and get dumb luck. But somewhere along the line this dude changed. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's that he just says less. And he knows a little bit (or a lot) more about himself. He knows his strengths and weaknesses. This guy has really earned me as a fan. I have to eat my crow like a good boy and say Keanu Reeves is a much better actor and understands what it takes to be a great film actor.,9
capitanotm,"I am a big big John Wick fan. When i first saw it i was in love with the character and the idea and the freshness it brought to the table of action genre.

We spend few last days before movie arrived in high expectations and when we saw 9/10 rating on imdb we were like this will be HUGE! Couldn't wait to watch, since we really liked all the previous ones.

First three movies were amazing, they were progressing well, John had deeper and deeper character build, as did other character get, everything went very very good. First three movies were 8-8.5 even 9 at some points.

This one was crazy downfall. I can see everyday rating is getting lower and lower and i guess someone payed a ton of people to write similar fake ratings to build momentum until it does what i now think it is made for - make as much money as possible.

Nonsense, unrealistic scenes that went stupid, fighting which felt like they are preparing and training for real scenes to be taken, completely brainless involvement of blind man as an ultra killer who as it points in the movie is better than John himself.

I mean i can write real real long text about dozens and dozens problems with this movie. We are supposed to have some fantasy level of skills here, but just some level, a believable level, this went way beyond even strongest superheroes strength level at some points and i am not kidding! Its ridiculous!!!

Main villain is nonsense, its just so illogical in this universe. I was really really hoping that they can explore that Arabic part of the universe, fighting the Elders stronger snd stronger Elders, really exploring that mysterious part of universe, but no, he kills Elders like they are nothing, and then his main villain becomes young childish egomaniac that basically has no skills and no one knows how or why he reaches ultimate position at the Table. Crazy!!!

Ending is rushed as many parts of the movie, and feels utterly disappointing and unsatisfying, only good thing to some degree is scenes with Scott ""unrecognizable"" Adkins.

Keanu seems were off for the whole movie, like he has no energy, and he does more than superheroes do in this one, its just cringe after cringe after cringe. Disgusting what they did with movie and character!

To all John Wick fans who waited this so long and were si excited to see it.. you don't need to. Definitely not paying for it in cinemas! Stick to the first three movies and make some happy ending in your head. This is EPIC FAIL.",2
JuiceZee,"So full of ideas I am sure I need to watch it a lot more. Yeah it was great on the big screen. Like being there. Like you are a drone looking in on the action. Yeah some lemon haze half way in was a good choice for me. Better than a video game! Hard to believe I did not know so many of the spoilers since I followed the online info pretty closely. Over the last few pandemic years. Keanu is the quintessential action movie star. John Wick IS the wrathful deity. I have heard it will be available for streaming in May. I'll be running it all day.

Not for kids. Do NOT let your ex husband take little kids cuz he wants to see it. The good news is that it has intergenerational appeal as long as you are over 14 .",10
rockyandbullwinkle,"The fight scenes tell it all . . . Excruciatingly slow and overly choreographed. The guys he fights move forward and back like rag dolls without any effort on Keanu's part with overly emphasized movements. At one point the guy he was fighting had a gun and just held it limply waiting his turn to get his ass kicked. I saw the nods to the Matrix in a few scenes (the rain scene and the subway scene) which was interesting but I'm telling you the fight scenes were yawnworthy. The storyline was weak too . . . I thought he was going to take on the twelve but not only did he not do that but we are left with almost no knowledge about the 12. I would have liked to do more of a deep dive on that subject . . . Surely we could have investigated that more deeply in the THREE HOURS?? Keanu's movements are also getting too slow and deliberate. In a way I think that's why they ended his story . . . He probably wanted out. It was great to see Laurence Fishburne again since they snubbed him in the last Matrix movie but I would have liked to see more of a deep dive with his character. Overall I give this Mr Wick's swansong a ""C""",3
MattD12027,"I don't even know where to start. I love John Wick 1-3 and saw all three of them 2-3 times in theatres, with more repeat viewings at home.

John Wick 4 is an awful mockery of everything that made the franchise good. It is far too long and overindulgent - some filler shots go on for 20-30 seconds when they could have been 5 - and the movie lacks the kinetic realism of all the previous entries. The acting is bad, the dialogue is bad and even unnecessary at times, and plot is completely nonsensical.

WHY does he drive in circles around the Arc de Triomphe when he could just drive Montmarte? He later drives the motorcycle there...

How is the Eiffel Tower the closest the Bowery King can get him to Montmarte? That's where he was right before that!!

Ugh, and don't get me started on the Marquis nonsense. It's the worst kind of one-up-manship - illogical, unfounded, and a pure plot contrivance.

Hard pass.",2
RagScreen,"Yes - Reeves is much beloved in the media world and by fans and so called alike. He is a really good dude. Perhaps that's what accounts for the high scores here.

But it's just an average movie and some of the scenes (like pt3) are further examples of say a budding cook who doesn't know when to stop adding unnecessary things to a meal.

Stupid unnecessary scenes. It's like a bunch of yahoos talking over a comic book idea after snorting lines of coke and thinking it sounds cool in their daze.

Yen's blind swordsman character is pointless and you can tell he's only been hired because of that ""next level"" adversary and the fact the producers wanted a ""blind swordsman character"" nothing more.

His blindness is actually pointless. Why the fk can he read his poker hand? The blind swordsmen trope historically gets used way better than this nonsense.

It's just a bunch of shooting each other in various elaborate ways - I'm surprised the stage musical hasn't been made (pt 5 perhaps?).

Disappointing addition to the franchise and it needs to stop.",5
MisterJxroen,"I was fortunate enough to view 'John Wick: Chapter 4' in a double-bill (Chapter 3 prior to 4) avant-premiere screening at the theater with my family. I've always been a great admirer of the practical action sequences portrayed in the 'John Wick' films.

Undoubtedly, 'John Wick Chapter 1' remains my favorite, followed closely by Chapter 3. It definitely has something to do with the fact that the type of action and gun-fu felt so new back then. That is also the one main thing this fourth film suffers from in my opinion: innovativeness. Though this issue only really exists throughout the first half of the film.

The Paris sequences & pretty much all action sequences featuring Donnie Yen (as 'Caine') serve as a breathe of fresh air in this film. Some new weapons and technology such as the bow & arrow, the nunchucks and some fancy incendiary bullets make certain action scenes a joy to watch. Though the other sequences are certainly cool, I can't help but feel like I've seen it quite a few times already.

The cinematography was definitely at it's highest point in this fourth film. The movie was absolutely gorgeous. The colors are vibrant and ultramodern, almost in a science fiction-y way. The way action sequences are shot have always been amazing; from long takes to overhead shots, back to running between cars on the Champs-Elysees and dueling like it's the wild west. It's a lot of bloody fun! I'm slightly saddened by the fact so much action was shot in dark and distractingly lit environments, but overall the practicality of it all was still there.

I enjoyed the music more in the prior movies, though I haven't separately listened to the OST yet so I know what to do. Sound design, costumes and world building is another massive win for me. I love this world they've managed to create full of assassins and strange people. It was nice to explore so many different countries and 'continentals'. It really helped with making this film different from the others.

Keanu Reeves is always a joy to watch, what else can I say? I'm also very happy they brought in legends like Clancy Brown, Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada. Their skills and overall badass vibes just fit so fell in this world. Speaking of legends, I'm saddened by the recent passing of Lance Reddick, who portrayed 'Charon' the concierge. I'm glad to have seen him one last time in this role and I pay my respects.

Overall I rate this film a 8/10, on par for me with chapter 2. If you come to see John Wick absolutely kicking people's ass while also breaking his own back numerous times (you'd think), this is the right film for you. You don't really get a lot of opportunities to breathe, and I love it.",8
collinsjamesjc,"John wick is one of the best characters in a long time but this film imo is the worst of them all. I don't know where the good reviews are coming from. The story is all over the place and doesn't follow with the rest of the franchise, there is so many action sequences that last far too long they become tedious and quite Frankly boring, they've added in the male version of Halle Berry's character from the 3rd film which does doesn't really fit....it's lost that slick, stylish skillfulness of John wick and it all just seems abit loose and all over the place.

They keep trying to find ways to kill him or get him out of the game...seems like it's all just made up on the spot and pulled from thin air, different groups of killer teams, different rules, is he excommunicated or not..who knows anymore?!

All in all the worst of the franchise, nothing will beat the first and I hope they don't ruin it even further.

P.s. I'm writing this review whilst watching that's how boring it is.",5
fallyhag,"I enjoyed the first film. 2nd was okay. Loved the dogs in the 3rd. But found this one painfully repetitive.

The story was ridiculous. It was parody on steroids. Even the loyal fanboy must be left thinking WTF!? It just rolls from one macho cliche to another not even trying to be a good film. Just lots of pointless fights. CGI blood. Predictable outcomes and plenty of convenient plots.

The lighting was wonderful though...

But just too many super hero characters that defy science and biology. What is the point of sitting through countless fight scenes when you know they won't be killed? It got so damn repetitive I genuinely lost interest.

The sicophants will love it. But those who enjoy a good film will be left head scratching. And yawning.",6
mybrown-34358,"I'm gonna have to rewatch this one another day. But I found myself beginning to doze off repeatedly like an hour 1/2 into the movie. I can't quite put my finger on it. The villain was definitely boring, the story line and dialogues seemed a bit stretched out. The fight scenes and overall feel of them didn't quite do it for me like the first 3 movies did. I think there's gonna be mixed reviews on this one. I felt there were several plot holes. And I'm in limbo about how I feel about the ending. It seemed fitting but then also didn't...? Lol. Idk man I just think some lazy writing went into play on this one.",6
Smiling_slinky,"I haven't written a review on IMDB in a while, but after watching JW4 last night I wanted to get my thoughts out there, although they are seemingly against the majority of fans and reviewers out there.

My thoughts on the series as a whole are that #1 was something special. It made me and many of its fans feel something when we watched it. It had emotional impact and weight, that really was the core of the movie. Sure the action was innovative and fantastic, and Keanu was awesome, but it was all meaningful and heavy.

Number #2 did a lot of things wrong that started the downfall of the series. The lore of the continental assassins universe was just botched plain and simple, and it lead to horrible writing decisions. Instead of John taking on a mission of his own will like the first, a new rule is invented as a plot devise to ""make"" him do something, which was pointless anyway because he then tries to kill the guy who is making him do all this anyway. Then instead of being an amazing assassin and figuring out how to kill the guy, he just breaks the main rule and gets everyone rightfully against him because he broke the one rule. It also introduced the stupid invincible suits that was the first step into fantasy and superpowers.

#3 was a huge downgrade further, with far more ridiculous continental lore, terrible writing like having John do one thing, only to undo that by doing the opposite which he could have done in the first place, even more fantasy magic suit nonsense, and multiple massive injuries that should have killed him, like cars hitting him and falling off a building onto metal railing.

After hearing great things about it from personalities I listened to, I had high hopes that the silliness of #3 would be left behind with #4, but those were lies. #4 doubles, triples, quintuples down on all the worst parts of #3. More stupid suit nonsense. A dog mauling people throughout the movie. Cars hitting John multiple times, and at least deadly falls off buildings that doesn't slow him down. It's as bad as fast and the furious now, maybe even worse.

I was thinking about why it was so bad, and it occurred to me that you really couldn't parody this movie. Think about typical John Wick clich√©s that you could parody. Maybe having a joke of him shooting someone in the head way too many times when its not necessary, oh wait this has that already. Having him fall from obviously deadly height, only to brush it off and get up, oh it has that. Have him get hit by 5 cars in a row, that would be funny, oh wait they had that too.

Perhaps the worst for me is the ending, and the writing is so bad, I'm not even sure its worth breaking down. None of the writing or decisions make sense, and it seems the writers thought they were being deep, and it seems people are falling for it at the moment. I can only hope that once the hype wears off people can think clearly and realize how awful the story is and

To sum it up, even after #3 I still felt I saw a John Wick movie and hoped they could at least do more of that, but even those low expectations were dashed. From a technical standpoint this movie could be a 6, but making this franchise into a parody of itself is not something I can overlook, and I think it needs to be called out. I was more unhappy than I was happy while watching this, which puts it under 5, and the more I thought about it, the more appalled I became, so in all honesty this is a 2 for me.",2
Revo94,"The latest edition of John Wick follows the same disappointing footsteps of Chapter 3. The first two John Wick movies were the best because they were more grounded and realistic. Their plot even though it was simple and straightforward it made way more sense than the latest two movies. Having also better writing, being more focused and having better villains helped them quite a lot. Also the fight scenes were far better than this movie

As we see in Chapter 4 the John Wick franchise follows the same path the Fast and Furious movies took. The first movies were the best for obvious reasons as i mentioned above and the more deep they expanded their universe and characters the more dumb the movies became. In this movie we have Daredevil fighting enemies without breaking a sweat and John seems to have complete invulnerability like he is Superman. There isn't any tension, or a sense of thrill or dread and fear in any of the fight scenes they show. The fight scenes in the first two chapters were way better because John/Keanu reacted faster so age does play an important role and most importantly they were directed better being more grounded and realistic. Being smaller scale helped them shine more, and in this one being having big scale set pieces wasn't the best choice. Moreover the villains in this movie they are straight from a fan-fiction cartoon acting incredible dumb, having the worst lines possible that it becomes not fun to watch at all. And don't make me laugh, i cringed so much with the dog and the guy who chases John especially in his last couple of scenes.

I generally don't recommend this movie at all and if you are a truly fan of the action genre that respects both the writing and the choreography and fight scenes of these movies i don't recommend this one at all. At least this movie had great cinematography so that's a positive. But in all other aspects from writing, directing and pacing, it did such a bad job.",5

juspain-80969,"Most of the negative reviews cover why this movie is so bad. It's just unbelievably the same thing over and over again for too long. I'm pretty sure out of the hundred of people that were murdered in this movie, they were the same 5 stunt actors over and over again.

I went with my buddies to this movie. Afterward we all thought this movie was horrible. One thought it was a comedy, because of the way the killings happen. I felt the assassins trying to kill Wick could have been soccer moms with no fighting experience, it was that off at how they could miss shooting a guy standing next to him. I dozed off for about 10 minutes.

Overall there's no plot or story. It's just a bunch of confusing nonsense and horrible acting. This will be a forgettable movie. Do yourself a favor and skip it.",1
stuit,"I paid $10 usd to see this movie at a matinee. The eye candy made the price worth it. That said, eye candy is almost all this experience offers. Most everyone involved in this film seemed like they were sleepwalking when the action stopped. It doesn't matter - everything in this picture is done for style points. There's barely any story here at all, and what story exists is so thin that it could be told in about 2 minutes of this 169 minute film. The remaining attempt to tell a story is so full of holes supported by bad acting and bloated style that it would have been a much better film just to leave it all out and just show a montage of fight sequences.

The Marquis character never shows the ability to do anything except sneer in an outrageous French accent and surround himself with dumb lieutenants. The Bowery King and the Harbinger characters are trotted out at the beginning and the end of the story just to to provide some atmosphere.

Rina Sawayama's acting ability is confined to contorting her face in into pithy expressions in response to her character's father's philosophical meanderings.

Even though small arms fire fills the air and bodies pile up on the road, cars continue to drive around the Champs-√âlys√©es as if nothing is happening.

The same thing happens during the disco scene, where perfect 20-something bodies continue to obliviously dance away while axe killings splatter blood all around them.

The DJ drops the needle on a record to start a song (bad sign for a DJ), while the old reel-to-real tape keeps spinning...just because they look better spinning I guess.

This isn't really a movie; it's more like a moving painting. I'm grateful for the resolution at the end of the film, because I feel sorry that the actors and the characters they play have to keep living out this drivel.",3

This movie was an absolute blast! One of the best action movies i have seen in quite a while and perhaps the best movie of the franchise!

The odds and stakes have yet again been risen and John has to fight like never before, coming to terms with who he is! This was an intense and emotional ride with amazingly choreographed fight scenes that transcends what you would deem possible in a movie! Outstanding use of marcial arts and many of the scenes are insanely well shot with incredible long takes that will stick with you! Some out of this world set pieces! Soundtrack was amazing as well and gives you just the vibe you need!

Caine was by far my favorite addition to the movie! He steals every scene!

This movie shows how you can still make one of the best action moviez without using CGI! Honestly its mindblowing how good this movie is! The almost 3hr. Runtime, flew by!",9
darryl-johnson,"Ridiculous, ultra violent and nearly 3 hours long 'John Wick: 4' is pure escapism at its finest. No one goes to see a 'John Wick' movie for anything remotely close to realistic fights or gun battles- it's about the body count, hand to hand combat and just how far the director will take things as John absorbs so much abuse yet hardly comes away with a scratch!

I usually avoid movies like this however will admit it took my mind off the daily crap of life. This one is much better than the last one- Halle Berry's character was more annoying to me than a female killing machine complement to Keanu Reeves' character.

There are scenes in Paris, New York and Berlin - topnotch cinematography that surpasses the other films. And the fight scenes are well scripted- kudos to the work Reaves and the stunt people put in to make them outrageously entertaining!

Is this the last film in the series?

Maybe... However if this brings in a ton of money rest assured there will be another one.",8
Top_Dawg_Critic,"Still one of the best action films of the best action film franchise, but I can only give this one a 9/10 when the first three films all got 10/10's. The main reason is that for this one being the longest of them all, the plot had more holes and the random new characters lacked the background they needed.

Throwing in Mr. Nobody was just dumb, as was his story. It was just too random and lazy, especially with all that extra runtime. Having all the opportunities to collect the bounty was just too easy and took away from all other more deserving assassins to collect, and more importantly, his reasons for not cashing in were just too unbelievable and ridiculous. Instead of introducing him as a new character, they should've capitalized more on Fishburne's character and involved him more in this film, instead of him being a delivery boy - that was just a huge let-down.

And as much as I love all the action scenes - and they were the best and longest thus far, they just didn't feel as authentic as the action in all the precious films. In the three-hour runtime, there's maybe a 15-20 min story, the rest is overboard non-stop action that is mostly ridiculous - yes, still the best I've ever seen, and it will probably be a long time before that's topped, if ever, but so much of it with so little story, unbalanced the overall viewing experience. The current narrative barely constituted a two-hour film, let alone three hours. Nevertheless, still an amazing film, it's the writing that could've been better and more in abundance.",9
HabibieHakim123,"Yes, you can absolutely feel the length, there is no way you wouldn't feel the length, besides the obvious, nit picky here and there, John Wick: Chapter 4 fills with the best character in the franchise so far, Bill Skarsg√•rd was a menacing great villain, another best one in the franchise, Donnie Yen was a badass in this movie, and Keanu Reeves as the great John Wick, killing it again in the role, and the rest of the cast were all great, John Wick: Chapter 4 was the grandest of them all, in terms of a story and action, clocking at 2 hours and 49 minutes, Wick's at his god mode giving some of the most brutal, exciting, and epic action scene in movie history, as a whole, John Wick: Chapter 4 was really something else, something that you never seen before, in it's length, the movie offers you a whole complete story fills with an exciting, intense, brutal, and epic action, great story, and great characters, it's a hell of a great wild memorable one time movie watch experience, second best in the franchise below Parabellum and above the rest.",9
qstufie,"If you enjoyed JW 1-3, you can't miss this one. It's the ultimate visual feast of blood, bullets and magic, yes magic, read on.

It started with JW getting out of the situation alive (again) after falling off the top of hotel continental and continue to rid the world of fellow hitmen (yeah why were there no hitwemen, just wondering).

Except that he gets a partner this time, no one else but Ip Man himself, or maybe Zatoichi, yeah more like Zatoichi with eyes can't see, and a cane sword (sword cane)? And aptly named 'Cane'. Except that Cane kills him at the end, anyway that's not important.

What's important is, the action! The action is over the top (not that the first 3 wasn't over the top, but this time it's over the topmost of the previous tops), so normally JW uses the ground as his weapon, now he uses cars as well, and stairs.

Damn I would hate these stairs, especially when you just finished climbing up 20 flights of stairs and got kicked back to the very begining of it. But they do act as effective weapons when you toss the body of your enemies on top the stairs.

And the magic!

First of all, the fantastic animal, this time, in a dog form, who listens to her emotional support companion (the tracer)'s commands, and acts accordingly. Honestly I think she needs anger management that's why she has an emotional support human for her.

Then there's the weapon that shoots fireballs and light up anything they touch - just like in the games - yeah also top down view, reminds me of the orginal psx grand theft auto, but way more fancier. Heck even the ragdoll movements of the bodies were just so ... identical. I totally enjoyed that.

That's 2 and half hours total enjoyment without a break - don't drink too much water before or during the movie and you can thank me later.

Now, why only 8 points?

Well, also the action - they must have changed the action director cos this time the enemies don't swarm JW anymore, they wait, like civialised citizens, they take turns to hit him, and only when the first one is down the second one will join, there was no rush at all. So yeah I have to take 2 stars off for that reason.

Overall, very enjoyable and certainly will get the bluray when it comes out (yes I have the first 3 on 4k bluray).

Don't let your kids watch it, they might get the wrong idea like wow I can be that strong and take on the world by myself.

No son, you can't, you are more likely to get a bullet through your brain, don't try that.",8
ryanpethrow,"John Wick 4 picks up where the previous film left off, and it does not disappoint. Keanu Reeves returns to the titular character, John Wick, and once again delivers a breathtaking performance that is sure to leave fans in awe. However, this time around, Reeves is not the only one stealing the show. Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsg√•rd, and Lance Reddick join the cast, and their performances are nothing short of outstanding.

Yen, a martial arts legend, brings his incredible skills to the movie and delivers some of the most brutal and cool action scenes in the film. Skarsg√•rd plays a new villain who is as menacing as he is unpredictable, and his scenes with Reeves are intense and thrilling. Reddick, who has been a fan favorite since the first movie, continues to shine as the enigmatic hotel manager, and his interactions with John Wick are as entertaining as ever.

The movie is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has been with the franchise since its inception, and he continues to showcase his expertise in creating thrilling and visually stunning action sequences.

But it's not just the acting that makes John Wick 4 a standout action movie. The work of the stuntmen is absolutely incredible. The fight scenes are brutal and fast-paced, and the choreography is flawless. Every punch, kick, and gunshot feels real and impactful, and it's clear that a lot of time and effort went into perfecting each moment. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI is also noteworthy, as it makes the action feel more grounded and visceral.

The supporting cast in John Wick 4 also deserves recognition for their performances. Halle Berry is a standout, and her character's relationship with John Wick adds an emotional layer to the movie. Laurence Fishburne and Ian McShane, who both appeared in previous films, continue to deliver excellent performances, and their characters' interactions with John Wick are always a joy to watch.

The music in John Wick 4 is yet another aspect that deserves praise. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard once again provide a score that perfectly complements the action on screen. The music builds tension and excitement, and it enhances the overall experience of watching the movie.

Of course, as with any action movie, there are some flaws. The plot can be convoluted at times, and some of the characters' motivations may not be entirely clear. However, these issues are easily forgiven in light of the incredible action and performances.

In conclusion, John Wick 4 is the ultimate action sequel. Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsg√•rd, and Lance Reddick all deliver outstanding performances, and the stunts, direction, and music all contribute to making this movie a must-see for action fans. The franchise continues to raise the bar for what an action movie can be, and John Wick 4 is no exception. If you're looking for a thrilling and entertaining ride, then don't miss this movie.",10
steliosk-2,"An action videogame in big screen with unlimited ammo and god mode. Reminded me the old days i played doom, or coin up games feeding them 50cent every time i loose.

The photography was the only thing i loved in this movie.. An absolutely masterpiece, no doubt about it.

The plot is not more than 15 minutes and the rest 2.30 hours is duke nukem in god mode.

As for the actors (when there was movie in this massive and boring action) Keanu felt like he was boring to speak, many action scenes looked completely fake, the chorography was too bad like dancing in some cases.

What's the point of wrestling and shooting in the head and re-wrestling, yeah yeah i know the suits are bulletproof its fine, but too much chorography with no reason.

The franchise lost me after the 3d movie..

The first one was a masterpiece, great script, great purpose, great action. The fourth movie is continuance mixed with a videogame.",3
karanitsch_stefan,"The movie was simply bad. To much over the top unrealistic action, to a point where it became stupid and to much bad written dialog. I dond know who this movie is for. Waste of time and waste of money. Sad to see, that talent in the film industry seems to continue to decline.

The camera shots looked in most of the scenes quite impressive. That is kind of the reason I gave this movie 3/10 stars. Half of the time I was looking on my watch, hoping the movie ends.

From the reaction of other people during the movie i got the same expression. Everyone was laughing at action scenes that weren't intended to be funny..",3
lenses-39397,"John Wick 1 was over the top - but a plausible story for Hollywood purposes, and very entertaining. It has devolved to JW4 which is virtually unwatchable as a movie. If you can COMPLETELY suspend logic, you may be able to muddle through, but that isn't me. I can't believe it is many others either, but then again, sadly it is. Piece of crap would be complimentary.

The fight scenes are a joke of complete disbelief.

The story is weak.

Blind guys can not avoid bullets in a gunfight/ Kevlar ""suits"" can not protect wearers from grave harm.

""Everyone"" can not be thisclose to being able to beat the greatest ever.

Women can't realistically fight highly skilled warrior men - no less multiple men.

The sad thing is that this COULD HAVE been done well. The formula for a JW movie is ""the boogeyman."" Every extra in the movie can not come close to that level - that is horse crap. Trying to make each movie bigger and more extreme than the last is a mistake, destined for failure. This movie failed miserably. Writer, director, producers - complete hacks.",2
persister-71174,"I was greatly disappointed with #4. The story line was weak. If all you care about is mindless fighting and shooting, you will be happy. I know that is the key element in this story, but people still need a good story, and some actual acting. As it was released, it is already quite long. So, I feel that they could have eliminated much of the ridiculous fighting in the traffic circle of Paris and added more meat to the story. Too much of the movie was incomplete. There could have been more for Lawrence Fishburne. And they could have done more with Shamier Anderson. I understand that they wanted to close out the series with John Wick's name restored. So, they could have done more, in the latter half of the movie, with his efforts to restore his name. This movie just didn't come together for me. As it stands, I think John Wick should have died at the end of John Wick 3.",3
TheDanishMovie-Nerd,"John Wick Chapter 4 is a phenomenal action movie destined to be remembered as a cinematic masterpiece. From start to finish, the film delivers an unforgettable experience that will leave audiences breathless.

Every character in the film is badass and engaging. The titular character, John Wick, played brilliantly by Keanu Reeves, is again on a mission to take down his enemies. His journey is filled with captivating and memorable characters. Every actor in the film stands out and gets their fair share of screen time, bringing their A-game to the table and making each character a force to be reckoned with.

The stunt work in John Wick Chapter 4 is incredible and the best ever put to film. The fight scenes are creative and thrilling; every single one is an absolute masterpiece. The creativity and attention to detail that went into choreographing these scenes are astonishing. It's easy to see that the filmmakers spared no expense ensuring that every fight scene was a work of art.

What elevates this movie is the cinematography. Every frame could be a framed piece of art. The film is so beautifully shot that it's hard not to be in awe. The lighting, the colours, and the camera angles all work together to create a stunning visual experience that will leave you breathless.

The script of John Wick Chapter 4 is air-tight, and it's filled with fantastic quotable one-liners that will satisfy even the most hardcore old-school action fans. The dialogue is clever, witty, and sharp and perfectly complements the film's intense action sequences.

It's hard to understand how the John Wick franchise keeps topping itself with each new release, but Chapter 4 is the series' pinnacle. Action movies are in a great place right now, with John Wick and Mission: Impossible showing us how to make amazingly well-crafted action movies. It's unsurprising if these types of films overtake superhero movies as the box office's dominating genre.

In conclusion, John Wick Chapter 4 is a must-see for any action movie fan. The film's impressive visuals, memorable characters, and incredible stunt work all contribute to making it one of the best action movies ever made and a contender for the best genre movie ever created. It's a cinematic masterpiece that should not be missed.",10
rgkarim,"LIKES

Acting -It's simplistic, it's extreme, and it's these characters that you love to just grip on to in the grand scheme of things.

-And yet it all works together in this action heavy movie, to still create these elements that you love in this film to have a little more meat than some other films in the action genre.

-I disagree with the top billing, but I have a trend so.

-Georgiou is fine for the like three minutes in the film, and sadly his story does not have much merit to the film, so let's move on.

-Ian McShane is excellent as Winston, cultured, classy, and though not the star, stealing the show in those moments with well-executed class, poise, and comedic delivery.







-Fisburne is fine for when he is on stage, he just needed more time, involvement and dare I say development that Chapter 3 and the commercial s promised.

-As for Reeves, the man may not be the best actor, but he is awesome in terms of stunts, very blunt edges, comedic delivery (intentional and unintentional), and just that feeling by saying little. He struggles with, well some other things, but somehow it works given his character.

The Story Building -I've said it several times, but yeah, there is a bit more of the story in this one and much more character development than the past.

-Wick's fourth chapter really starts to expand upon Wick's background, while opening up the facets of new characters and trying to help build more of the past.

-It's endearing, it's deeper, and establishes layers to characters for books, and other media can expand upon if the movies ever dry up or won't go down the prequel path.

-And this particular chapter has enough of the now moments to help things really engage and be intense to help Wick's story continue to expand into levels that just make you continue to root for this character.

-Which leads to the next like.

The Emotions Surprisingly -This movie is emotional because it really pushes into those little divots from the past and extends them to more engaging character moments.

-Chapter 4 uses the music, the footage, and the story to great levels and establishes moments that help ground the action and silence the action edge.

-And it's extraordinarily balanced to the point that it only adds not takes away from the story, and gives stakes and care to the action sequences they designed.

-Having such investments into this movie helps get past the usual stereotype of mindless action without much else, and if you are hooked to Keanu's character, you are in luck with this installment really polishing him up.

The Special Effects -You have to make this movie shine to capture the action and make it really shine in this world that makes ""action"" movies.

-It works. Wick's scenes have the sound to capture and bring you into the mix. Bullets bouncing, clips discharging, swords clanging and explosions rattling with the music.

-But the audio only goes so far if you don't have the visuals, and Wick's team has you covered there with tricks and trades that make the insanity come to life.

-Amidst impressive sets, Wick has stellar visual effects as the extras go flying from the stunts as computer and reality combines to make believable bouts of death on the screen.

-Flashes of guns, people falling back, blood, and reactions all work together and really make things that insane bout of action that I expected and love in this series.

-And it's all captured with camera work and editing that doesn't get lost to shaky work, or that realistic found footage twist that annoys me with some action films. That works super well with me.

The Action Sequences -The heart of this movie, Wick is all about the action. Clocking in at roughly 88% of the movie by my calculations, Wick's longest film adds A LOT MORE action than I anticipated.

-Simplistic at first, the movie evolves to add story elements to each fight, while also adding different styles to help diversify the profile , which I greatly appreciated.

-Sword fights with physical moves and gunplay opens up at one point, and then we switch to different combats the next as the five sequences help add new styles to freshen things up.

-And again it works with the emotion and the story to help add that stakes I like, alongside some of the justice filled finishes you love so much.

Dislikes:

Too late for this level of Storytelling -Was the storytelling too late? In a sense for me, yes. Wick may not be known for the plot, but to take such strides and character development this late in the game might have been weaker to me.

-These new relationships seem random. The history lost to the fast pace and stunts, that they don't have the full time to commit for me to be worth it.

-Throw in the ploy to potentially capitalize on it further and well... it's not the worst, but it just didn't have the full meat I think they could have done.

Some Plots Rushed -The fast pace means the attempts to build plots is also very quick, this film trying to tie many elements from 1-3 into one film, which means lots of details to revisit.

-Nostalgia wise, it worked for me, but these moments were very quick, and limber, again leading to a weaker story in my opinion.

-For an action flick it's good, but for the legacy of Wick, it could have been better, and perhaps this is going to be a lead in to some spin off given the trend of Hollywood and streaming.

Loud In My Showing -I may sound old, but if you have sensitive ears, caution for the movie is very loud to the point it can be very distracting.

-If you too are sensitive, just exercise caution so you don't injure anything.

Still Some Level of Absurdity -I know Wick is already extreme and absurd at times, but I'm always looking to see where they go too far.

-And this movie has a few moments that are a bit hard to swallow and ignore at the cheese factor that they take to make their fantasy come to life.

-One thing is the costumes they adorn and how selective their immunity is, there is a little more explanation, but it's quite amazing to see the double standards.

-Other times it's about the invincibility factor that Wick seems to have, alongside the recovery part that gets stretched a little too much for my tastes. It might be part of the magic, but, the absurdity still is going a tad too far since the first movie.

The Final Sequence Makes the Movie A Tad Long -I'm one for action, but in this case, the final fight sort of extends the feature a bit longer than I personally enjoy given how absurd the final moment is.

-A climb so to speak goes a tad longer, and though the moves are awesome, the comedy great and the tying of things together works... it does not offset that it wasn't needed given what was coming.

-Chapter 4's length is going to be a solid hook for the die-hard fanbase, but for others like me, that final fight just goes a tad too long given there is still another action moment to come.

The After Credit Scenes -The fact there is one has me shake my head, but that aside, this chapter serves as something to try to tie up a loose story end they forgot, or maybe set the stage for what is next.

-All I can say is that a long list of names to get there was mediocre in terms of what could be set up when it comes the world the High-Table focuses on. But was it needed? My opinion... no, not at all.

The VERDICT: John's fourth adventure was shaping to be one of the best action movies for me in a long time, and perhaps one of the best in this series. It's got heart, emotion, and depth I did not expect as the worlds collided and it balanced a lot of things to integrate into the action moments. The movie is visually impressive, a stunning collaboration of sound and video that combined with the planning, just gives this elite fighting movie moxie to make you squirm in your seat. And with all the dark antics and violence, this genre really does have a pinnacle sequel on hand to give the fans more of what they want, but actually push the envelope with it. And yet.. the movie still has things that are needing fine tuning to push to the pinnacle of movies. Absurdity is one thing, but pacing still has some things to work on to help give the movie the bite it wants, alongside the fact of trying to do a pinch more of character balancing that they seem to struggle. Nevertheless, this movie is definitely the leading film of the month right now, and has many things to drag you to the theater to see it. My scores are:

Action/Crime/Thriller: 9.0

Movie Overall: 8.0.",9
GusherPop,"Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves have returned with ""John Wick: Chapter 4,"" a film that was supposed to hit theaters two years ago. It was worth the wait, combining the mythology-heavy approach of the last couple chapters with the streamlined action of the first film, resulting in a final hour that is among the best of the genre. John Wick: Chapter 4 opens with Wick (Reeves) on the run from the villainous Powers That Be known as the High Table. The main villain of the series is the Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsg√•rd), a leader of the High Table who keeps raising the bounty on Wick's head while he also cleans up the messes left behind. The opening scenes take Wick to Japan, where he seeks help from the head of the Osaka Continental, Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada), and runs afoul of a blind High Table assassin named Caine (Donnie Yen). Laurence Fishburne pops up as Wick's Q when the killer needs a new bulletproof suit, and Shamier Anderson plays an assassin waiting for the price to hit the right level for him to get his payday. Despite the movie's epic runtime (169 minutes), the plot feels refreshingly focused again. The only minor flaw in Wick's armor is a bit of narrative self-indulgence, but fans won't care. This is a movie that should be seen with a cheering, excited crowd, as it has that contagious energy and is meant to be watched loud and big. John Wick has fought hard for it. The stunts and fight choreography of John Wick are top tier, and the director, Chad Stahelski, got his start in the movie industry as a stuntman.""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is by far the best of the four films starring Keanu Reeves as the eponymous hit man. It has many of the same problems as its predecessors, but something happens late in the game that converts the film's merely technical displays of bloody murder into something suspenseful and romantic. Director Chad Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, and there's fresh blood in the cast, most notably Donnie Yen as blind assassin Caine and Scott Adkins as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth. The details are too good to give away, but there's no harm and much pleasure in considering how the movie climbs to that light-headed summit. The movie reprises the basic structure of past films, with Wick (Keanu Reeves) slicing his way through the henchmen of his former employers, the High Table. The stunt work is spectacular, with human bodies being hurled into moving vehicles and Reeves's double tumbling down the Sacr√©-Coeur stairs. Stahelski also delivers one extended, mind-bogglingly complicated fight sequence in a single shot, the camera floating overhead. Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, and introduces fresh blood in the cast, such as Donnie Yen as blind assassin Caine and Scott Adkins as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth.",10
maximkuzmin-09303,"Previous movies had a better story with more dialogues to make it interesting. Just felt like the movie was running out of ideas for the story and dialogues. But the action scenes were amazing shooting & fight scenes were taken to another level. Filming one shooting scene from above to see what is going on the other side of the room was awesome and interesting.

Hopefully this will be a lesson for the producer, that people want dialogues aswell as action in movies. Not just Keanu saying sorry and you owe me... The dialogues were to few for today's audience to completely enjoy this movie. Story and dialogues are as important as action in a movie.",6
hfreinoso,"John Wick Chapter 4, directed by Chad Stahelski and stars Keanu Reeves as the main character John Wick. This is the best film of 2023, already. There I said it. It's already the best film of 2023. John Wick's Chapter 4 is one of the best action films this decade. I enjoy this film, no; I loved this film. I loved this film, My dad and I watched John Wick's Chapter 1 on opening day, and now we watched it on opening day; and Chapter 4 didn't disappoint us at all; we had the best time with this film. Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, and Scott Adkins were brilliant in this film, and they didn't disappoint us in this film as it's such a good plot during this film. The story is well done as it shows and expands the new assassin world. And the action, I can keep going on and on about the action and I am so anticipated that I want to see the movie again, of how good the action is especially the overhead scene that was inspired by Hotline Miami. That scene alone made this film a masterpiece. I could watch it over and over again and I will never get tire of watching it. The story is really good and the ending was a huge plot twist, as we though there were going to make Chapter 5. And in all honesty if they end the story here with John Wick, that would be okay, because, I seriously don't know how on god's earth will they top this film. And If they ever do a Chapter 5, Please bring everybody back that did Chapter 1-4 for Chapter 5. My dad and I are huge fans and we will continue be fans, we love the film and for my dad it's already the best film of 2023 in his eyes. Cinematography, soundtrack, visuals are ALL astounding. There is only a nitpick and that is John Wick still is clean after all the fighting. Overall, John Wick's Chapter 4 is a true masterpiece of action filmmaking. It's a film that manages to exceed the high bar set by its predecessors, delivering a thrilling and emotionally engaging experience that leaves you wanting even more. If you're a fan of action movies or just great filmmaking in general, then John Wick Chapter 4 is an absolute must-see film. I give it a 10/10 rating without reservation. I am wanting this film to get this film a billion dollars at the box office, Because it deserves the money, and time to see on the BIG screen. I am going to see this film over and over again. It's a masterpiece. 10/10.",10
housermichael,"I am a fan of the actor Keanu Reeves from films like ""River's Edge"", ""Dangerous Liaisons"", ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", ""Speed"", and ""The Matrix"". And I have recently watched the three previous John Wick movies on video and I thought they were pretty good.

Now comes the new movie ""John Wick Chapter Four"" and nothing could prepare me for how great this movie is. It is easily the best John Wick movie and one of the best action movies ever made. The director Chad Stahelski and the star Keanu Reeves have outdone themselves and created an excellent film that is one of the most entertaining movies of the year as long as you don't mind the nonstop violence.

The movie is violent but beautifully choreographed with colorful and superb production design. This is the best action movie since ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and one of the best movies of the year.",10
jp_91,"""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is a film that offers what its trailer promises: action and more action, achieving a product whose production is outstanding, colorful cinematography and risky camera movements, as well as outstanding editing work and a soundtrack well done. Its big problem, the negative point, is the most important part: the script, which is repetitive, tired and unimaginative, exploiting the action theme without really having a coherent story. Everything ends up being absurd only with a good job in the fight choreography. An overrated film, practically bad and with an excessive duration for the null story it tells.",3
ykjdh,"This is by far the best action movie to come out the past 15 years! Yup, I said it and stand by it! Can you find a movie character more exciting than John Wick?? Jason Bourne is a close second but the visuals in this franchise make this series fun to watch.

Fast forward to this installment where the stakes are higher for John Wick. There are a lot of twists and turns in this one, along with some of the best fight choreography in movies. The longer running time didn't really seem like much since the pacing of this film is fast and exciting.

One note: Lance Reddick's final onscreen performance was sentimental to watch. It's hard not to think about what happen recently with his passing while promoting this movie. Other supporting characters make it woke up until the very end but Reddick will be missed.",10
stu_god_2,"I paused the film at 1 hour 49 mins as I was thinking. When do people talk in the film? All Ive seen is back to back pointless fight scene after pointless fight scene with barely any dialogue.

The fight scenes are just getting stupid too. 150 men per scene it felt like , and they only come in 2s or 3s in a nice neat line for john and his pals to dispose of. Wearing more armor than the terminator. Im pretty sure john wick dodged more bullets in this film than the entire 4 matrix films put together. At least John wick 1 was alot more raw and u could actually feel like john was in real danger wen he was fighting but this one you just sit back, unplug your brain and watch neo ... I mean john , get to work.

The storyline was awful even for an all out action films standard. Looks like they concentrated on filming in the right location more than the story as EVERY scene was a massive beautiful room that only billionaires see.

I looked forward to this seeing this after looking at the great reviews but after watching I felt like my 11 year old son mustve written them all as hes the target audience. The fighting wasnt even that good as well. A blind ninja guy who can take anyone out in a blink but as soon as hes up against john he turns into an actual blind person lol

4/10 for homage to the first film and sequel. Overrated which is a real shame as love Keanu.",4
evanleejernigan,"Lets start!

Love J. W. 1-3 truly. Some of my favorite movies ever. Awesome believable fight scenes. No one is standing around waiting to die. Cool plot lines that make you want more. Believable reactions to extras in clubs and so forth. Great acting. The best ""Trilogy"" in the past 10 years.

Now 4.

The exact opposite of 1-3. I don't understand why people love it and call it the best? So confused. I feel betrayed they passed this weird B rated movie feel as a finale to a great series. The opening desert scene felt rushed on so many levels to the point it was cheezy and flowed really bizarre. The Club fight scene as stated by others was like watching a clip out of GTA gameplay. No ones reacting to people dieing. The stair scene was dumb as hell. You see the bad guys waiting for John to destroy the guy ahead of him and wait their turn to die. I could keep going but...what's the point. Most people love it. Call it the best movie ever and so forth. I'm the minority in my review of this. I have the upmost respect for Mr. Reeves. Awesome actor and wonderful human being. I blame the writers and editing. Heartbreaking!! You made a stupid movie.",2
cms-14228,"The John Wick movies have run out of ideas and just rehash the other movies. Keanu is still stiff and half asleep throughout the movie and luckily they give him very little dialogue. The other actors are superb especially Donnie Yen, who is an actual martial artist. He's so good he makes Keanu look especially bad. Scott Atkins is great and his martial arts skill shines in this movie.

The plot is ridiculous as usual and the killing count is very high. It seems like the director enjoys the same backgrounds.....church, falling down lots of steps, dance hall where everyone keeps dancing even though there is gunfire.

It lacks the humor of the Taken movies and great acting in the Equalizer.",1
tohmsono,"It's been a while since i watched such a dragged out and shallow movie with horribly unrealistic fighting and shooting sequences. Also, none of the characters have any depth, i guess that was never really the intent of the writers, to go deep into the personas, but this flick is so silly and boring it was really hard to sit thru till the end. The sheer amount of assassins that cannot pull off a head shot from 10 meters away is perplexing. To go into all of the illogicalities of this flick would be a tedious and long task, so in summary: it's like watching a video game. All of the reviews above 5 are simply because they like Keanu, but do not get fooled: this flick is garbage.",3
sehestedlasse,"Such a bad movie. 3 hour long fight where John has put on ""godmode"". Absolutely 0 story, besides just fighting. The whole theatre bursted out laughing because of the ridiculous fightscenes. I am left so angry and annoyed. Don't you ever go watch this pile of poop if you like anything that is the slightest realistic. More unrealistic than Marvel movies. It has absoluty nothing to offer. A blind guy who can fight, shoot and play cards? What is this? Maybe 12-13 year old kids would find this movie cool. This is as stupid as it gets. John Wick says nothing in the movie. It is absolutely pointless and meaningless.",1
AvionPrince16,"I saw so many action movies even all the previous John Wick movies and i need to say that this movie put the standard pretty high. The sequences, the shots without a cut, the long sequences of fights was spectacular and really brutal. I enjoyed also the music during the fights and really put a nice rythm to the fights and give dynamics and nervosity. Also the set design from Osaka to Paris was gorgeous and had so many small details that i couldnt keep my eyes off the screen. We had also the story who introduced the new vilain who supposed to be French and was pretty convincing. We have also some interesting discoveries all along during the movie (the blind man who have his daughter in hostage, the way to put an end to all this and to recover the status of the guy in charge of the continental who get destroyed in the movie. The fights feel great even if we know that match a certain choregraphy and dont reflect a real fight but it was well made and have some interesting shots (when at the end they all tried to kill Wick in the building and the camera shot from above all the scene and transform it like a mini map). Some scenes really look gorgeous and awesome and like i said i saw so many action movies but this one was really different; even in the work of the lights and how they put the lights to create a certain tone. It was pretty effective and sometimes some scenes was pretty funny (with the dog). The end is pretty sad and thought that John Wick will made it trough all that but he died. The Caine Character have an interesting style: the way he fights, but i think it was not necessary to make him blind because some scenes lack of logic sometimes and questions us to the believable situations that dont feel believable sometimes(the fights, the fact that nobody had the idea to shot him in the head quickly)but it was ok and give a new opponent/friend to John Wick in this episode. Give it a try. The actions scenes (because its mostly an action movie)was pretty awesome (Arc de Triomphe, Osaka, sacr√© coeur). And make it memorable and its one of my favorite John Wick and maybe favorite action movies for now? But it was awesome really. And even some dialogues was well written and some meaningful moments. The story was good for an avtion movie but its certainly not the most interesting part in the movie for sure even if it have some interesting moments and revelations and surprises( i didnt expect the death of the concierge so quickly in the movie to be honest). A nice action movie. No doubt about it.",9
lancelong777,"Watching John Wick 4 makes me realize just how bad of an actor Keanu Reeves is. Many apologies because he is one of my favorite people in movies. Notice I didn't say actor in movies as I think that after about 20-30 movies we can all honestly say that his skills have not improved nor have they changed. Having said that I will say that he is enjoyable to watch in movies like this even though I had to suspend my disbelief of my suspension of disbelief on multiple occasions. The story was not very interesting, the bad guy didn't seem very bad nor was I feeling like any of the action scenes made any sense - not that any movies really do. But I wonder just how many times a person needs to place a mag in a loaded weapon and then open the chamber to see if there is a round in the chamber. That was minor because I don't want to spoil alert anyone. I will say this however that if a spin-off is made or another John Wick is made I can honestly say I will not pay any money to watch either. Is Pirate Bay still around?",4
DavidPlaysThings,"I'm a big John Wick fan but I really didn't like this installment. I found it really bland and boring.

The main issue was that the stunts felt like they pulled a lot of punches. Almost every action sequence felt numb, like they didn't have any weight or any stakes. Fight scenes would go for far too long and yet leave absolutely no impact. Someone could fall off of a building, shake it off and be totally fine again. There were acrobatics, sure, but it felt like Power Rangers combat.

It also felt like this installment was being crushed under the weight of its own lore. The hints of greater lore and underlying history in the other movies were great, and part of what got me really interested in the continuing franchise. By the fourth installment this has become so all encompassing that it absorbs the whole movie in a convoluted plot of pomp and politics.",5
supergye,"As a cinephile and decades of watching action movies, one is not as tantalized by the mere act of killing and car chases. What Wick 4 attempts to do is bring the action to another level on top of the prior 3. Not an easy task given the relentless killing and video game level of endurance the main character has. It is akin to the experience of watching Fast and Furious. We know no one could survive the falls and gun fights, and that is part of the fun. The audience is in on the joke sort of speaking. Dialogue is used sparingly. The mystery of the High Table, the almost religious codex that is followed by the criminal organization gives the movies a greater meaning than perhaps the sum of its parts. Reeves is a perfect fit, and we cheer for him as he appears to be the best most conscientious of the worst the org has.",8
grovehill-69182,"OK, so the fight choreography, cinematography, locations and set pieces are great, but not great enough to save this film. It takes us nowhere different to where the first three took us. However, worse than that, it includes far too many over the top and completely unbelievable action sequences in which our hero gets hit, run over, shot, falls from great heights only to walk away from, that he may as well be Wile E Cayote in a Road Runner carton episode. I mean he falls from 3 or 4 storeys onto a car that crushes the roof and just gets up. In a scene around the Arc de Triomphe he's hit time and time again by numerous vehicles and just carries on like nothing's happened. It seems that everyone is now bulletproof just by putting an arm to their face when being shot at. In the fight scene on the huge flight of steps he just keeps rolling and rolling all the way down to the bottom when all the bad guys only fall a few steps when hit. Much has been made of the long fight sequences, but in fact they are too long and just become tedious and tiresome rather than exciting. The film is far too long to sustain what is a very flimsy and simple story. Shame as I loved the first John Wick, and didn't mind the second one too much either, but I'm sorry to say it has now run its course and if I wanted to see superhuman people who are bulletproof I would have gone to see a Marvel movie.",4
rob-74582,"And, I do mean LONG. I like a good fight scene but this was too much. Also, there were many instances that were simply unbelievable. If John is supposed to be a fantasy creature who can survive that which would kill any other human then so be it but I thought he was supposed to be human. I rated this movie three stars because of the quality actors and I like it when they don't put something together cheaply. So, if you can disregard all the improbability and just enjoy constant fighting you'll probably enjoy this movie. I prefer more substance and I don't play video games so there you have it.",3
sandeepyn,"John wick can crash agains 10 s of card, roll down flight of stairs multiple times and still survive.

Avoid the movies at all costs, and not mention hundreds of people of shooting at him one after the other and still does not die. John wick is basically in god mode in the movie.

JWJanneck,"I suppose if you've seen the previous installments, you had to expect this: an overlong sequence of the most absurd action with a massive body count, strung together by the thinnest of plots. If that's your thing, and it would seem it is for many people, then you will likely enjoy this film.

Myself, I got bored after a short while, because there is only so many times I can enjoy watching someone getting offed by a close-range headshot. The nearly three hours exceed that count by quite a margin, the various (interesting) locations, and (vile) opponents that make up said thin plot notwithstanding. After nearly three hours, I was glad this thing was over. I guess it works on a technical level (it *is* well made), but it didn't work for me. I hope it does for you.",3
saimariejohnson,"This chapter of JW was really amazing; action-packed, compelling, funny and star-filled. I was definitely enthralled and it never left you anywhere but on the edge of your seat. I found it to be engaging, funny, and thrilling while still feeling heartwrenching and shocking in so many different and unexpected ways. It was a movie that our entire family enjoyed and I feel Keanu hit the ball out of the park, per usual. This franchise is summarized in a bittersweet way but the ride is worth the ending nevertheless. Five huge stars for a wonderful ensemble cast! Loved this movie and really think most fans will too.",10
timteo,"Yes, I tried to make a pun out of the word ""Bewildered"" because this film seems like it tried to do just that- make a pun out of the actual John wick films. The first was undoubtedly the best- it was simple, realistic, unintentionally humourous and had a very clear goal. Then, it became a little over the top in the third, especially when he visited the elder and wanted to remain alive just so he ""could remember her"".

Huh.

Anyway, I had high expectations walking into the fourth instalment because I do love this franchise. However, it was far too much. The action sequences were shot well and choreographed fantastically but it was unrealistic even for a made believe world. Unless that was what they were going for? More of a Marvelesque/graphic 300 and Sin City- Zac Snyder type vibe? It was no doubt beautiful in terms of Sets, costumes and cinematography and ok, really do have to hand it to the stunt and action choreography team.. if there was an Oscar's category for stunts and fights, they will take it.

Unfortunately, no amount of ornaments are going to save a movie with a lack of story. The acting here and dialogue delivery is pretty weak... I was also confused with the motivation. I understand Winston and John's friendship but then again, why is he so hell bent on surviving? John hates the trade, he's out then he's in, then he's in with such a goal to survive but for what reason? So then he's back in and wanting to die ...with honour? It seems out of character to want to get people he cares about involved and die for him and he doesn't even know why he wants to live so bad and run from the high table ... then later, he's in the game again to take revenge for his Japanese friend but then doesn't end up avenging him in the end, the guys daughter had to do it herself. Look, I want to say something prolific and sound like a great movie critic but I'm not. So I'm going to just jump in here into the sea of 9s and perfect 10 reviews and hope I can land like John wick after rolling down 20 flights of stairs and not die.

I actually went into micro sleep at the 2hr mark because it was too much action. I know, it's crazy. But I woke up because an old couple had to pass me as they were walking out. They shook their heads, I think they were ready for some quiet tea and snacks.

Hey, you know what peeves me, is that john travels from Osaka to new York then to some other paris and no one kills him on the plane or even the airport? In air, there's no where to go, they would defo be able to kill him in the airplane toilet of even disguise as a hot flight attendant and spike his drink. Also, the blind guy is better than so many other assassins... also, they used the same freaking dog antics as Halle berry but with a black guy that's randomly introduced for fan service or something. Also, i totally saw it coming at the end, as if John will kill Donnie yen. But then they went back to the black guy while he's sitting there drinking beer with his dog and he's like ""that was good/smart"" and I'm like ""whut, no it's nhat"".

And like if you love your dog, you wouldn't be feeding it beer.. hello?

Then also, John fell from buildings and got shot up and is almost immortal. But at the end he just dies from a gunshot wound in his liver with no will to live. He says ""Winston, take me home"", then Winston is like ""yea ok"". But he doesn't even run after him, he just lets John walk down the steps and he dies. But like now he has no will to live? I thought his goal was to live to remember her. If anything, this should've happened in John wick 2, where he gives in after avenging his puppy and getting his car back, then should lie in the sunset to die and reunite with Helen.

Argh but nope he ""dies"". But then the Lionsgate production team realised what a hit this installment was and decides to do a number 5 and 6. So I guess John faked his death and then now comes out of hiding wants to avenge Donnie Yen or the Samurai dude, then they introduce jet li or Jackie Chan and omg it's going to be real Expendables type thing, brainless popcorn flick where everyone just fights real good fight scenes with explosions and falls, fire, snow ice and stuff, lots of injuries, cuts, bloods, 10000 stunt extra deaths, but the main guys limp but still fight with 100% blows and no one dies. Then the ending finally the bad guy has a real dramatic death with flowers and slow music and then John wick is like struggling but saves the day and says ""yeah"".

Ok rant over. Oh well, guess i will watch John wick 5 anyway just to see how bad it is. Lol.",4
neill-dunwoody-807-181790,"This has to the best action movie I have ever seen, I have to say I'm shocked to see the 4th movie in a cinematic universe be the best yet. It's non stop action from start to finish. Keanu is one of the greatest action stars to ever live. I really hope they make more. The fight choreography is second to none, the gun play better than ever, and the casting is stupendous. The plot is top notch, the Wickverse is better than the Marvel Universe and any film universe. He deserves all the plaudits for what he has done with this character. You need to see this movie multiple times. Best film I have seen at the cinema in a very long time..",10
grypedersen-04299,"Is this a game, or is this a movie? 90% of the movie is bad, exaggerated fighting. How many times can one be beaten before they stay down? An enormous number. How far does one roll down the stairs after being hit? Infinitely far... Thin plot, poor acting. Why did Keanu agree to this? Here, you get the feeling of watching a game, not a movie. Is the blind man blind, or can he see? One has to make up their mind and stick to the decision. Someone here has done a poor job with their homework. Let's hope this was the last movie, because we truly cannot bear the thought of there suddenly being a plausible reason to make another one.",2
matthewjones-56423,"This movie is so bad that I stopped watching it inside the theater to write this review...

What happened here?!? I was so excited to see this movie and now I feel so let down. I come to see ""John Wick"" films for the immaculate and creative fight choreography. Do not walk into this movie expecting any of that. All the purism which caused the first three films to shine is gone. The ""John Wick"" franchise has completely disappeared up its own a*s. This goofy underworld the movies created only worked when a normal world still existed in the Wick Universe. But there is no ""real world"" anymore. Every single character in this movie looks cartoonish, like a steampunk caricature of a real person. Even the villains were painfully cartoonish, one of them even sporting a full mouth full of ridiculous gold teeth. I couldn't even look at him without laughing.

Now, let's discuss the action and the fight choreography, the two biggest letdowns about this film. This was not just bad fight choreography for the Wick universe, this was bad fight choreography for a straight-to-streaming action movie of the week. As Wick is fighting various henchmen in the ubiquitous club fight scene that goes down in every Wick movie, you can literally see the enemy assailants waiting their turn to attack him. Numerous times, you can clearly see a henchman in the background literally just standing there swinging his weapon at nothing because it isn't his turn yet in the choreography to attack Wick.

Also, the ""Gun-Fu"" crap was novel and fun in the first two movies, now it's completely taken over. Rather than the dazzling martial arts, melee weapons, and close quarters combat we've come to expect from this franchise, we're now forced to settle for an endless barrage of gunfire and gratuitous headshots. There is very little actual brawling in this film. It's like the scene in Indiana Jones when he opts to just shoot the sword-wielding henchman rather than actually fight him. ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is just that scene repeated over and over and over again. Every time a new villain squares off to John and appears that they will be formidable, Wick just shoots them in the head immediately without even so much as a slap fight to satiate our palettes. It gets so boring to watch really fast. I think Keanu is getting up there in years and can't quite bring the fury like he used to; so, the filmmakers decided to just let him shoot everybody rather than fight them.

Now, let's go back to the big club scene and talk about how unrealistic this movie is. During the scene, the sprawling night club is packed to the rafters with club goers who appear to be dancing to different music than that which is playing. That's not even close to the silliest thing about them though. As though they were brainless party bots that knew only how to dance, these morons would just stand there gyrating poorly to generic Cyberpunk music while people were being brutally slaughtered by axe right next to them. None of them bats an eye, runs away, or attempts to protect themselves. They just keep on dancing like the NPCs inside a night club on Grand Theft Auto. It was some of the most negligent filmmaking I've ever seen.

Simply put, there was no grace to this film and it was a horrible way to end the franchise. To all of you out there saying that this is ""the best action film of all time,"" maybe you should rent ""The Raid: Redemption"" or ""The Raid 2."" Those are action films done so well they were basically art films. Iko Uwais is the most talented martial arts working in film today. Or, even easier, go rent ""Atomic Blonde."" As a former ballerina, Charlize Theron was able to memorize in excess of twenty moves at a time, which resulted in the directors needing to cut much less frequently, creating a very seamless, realistic effect to her fight scenes. The director referred to her as belonging to ""the top 1% of actors who can perform their own action."" ""Atomic Blonde"" is one of the best action films of all time and no one seemed to notice it. Such a crime...

Anyway, ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" sucked. You're better off staying home and sticking your head in the oven. Don't waste your money seeing this film in the theaters. It'll be on cable eventually, so just wait for it. This movie is where dreams go to die. Score: D+",1
strboudouridis-62513,"I do not understand the appeal of this franchise has to people and the high ratings. And because of that, I decided to watch the film. What a mistake, what a waste of time.

The script is super swallowed, every scene and dialogue it's a cliche, and the acting is so stiff. Fighting scenes seem to follow the same pattern. Keanu fights like a 56-year-old man. Maybe it would be better to use a stand man every time Keanu had to fight because even to an untrained eye it looks too slow.

I am going to forget this film really fast the same way I forgot the previous two. Only the first one had something to offer for a film of this genre.",1
JohnSnow95,"""How many different ways can we depict John Wick administering a headshot?"" should be the synopsis for John Wick 4.

This will no doubt be an unpopular opinion. Even in the theater people were going wild every time John Wick wrapped his leg around some henchman's head, flung him to the ground and then got the headshot, so it's no surprise to see the same online.

But for me it was repetitive. The bad guys always conveniently come in waves like it was a video game, they stagger around while he's fighting waiting for him to recover and then they strike, nobody can seem to shoot him (he kept holding his kevlar jacket up to his face but his arm and forearm were fully exposed as he did so), I could go on.

John Wick has more plot armour than James Bond, Jason Bourne and Denzel in The Equalizer put together.

Fell 20ft directly on his spine...gets back up.

Fell 30ft directly on top of a car...gets back up.

There's next to no plot. He wants out and he has to kill his way out. Which he does. Of course he does. And then he dies. That's it.

I liked the Japan scene but everything after that was like watching the same thing over and over.",1
colinhird,"Why oh why did I only look at the score for this film?!

After watching 2 and 3 and thinking they were a load of complete tosh I saw the score and couldn't wait to see this, thinking they had pulled it back.

Boy was I wrong, it's more of the same eye rolling over the top rubbish, nonsensical video game type action. I swear to god this generation of movie goers need to go out and leave the video games alone! Why are you rating this as good? Same as all the marvel rubbish!

If there are no stakes, no consequence and no physics how can you get invested in this? It's total, total rubbish, I'm fuming I had my hopes up for this!!!!",1
na-09069,"A funny or very sad movie?

I watched this movie with a friend while we did eat our ordered in dinner.

At first, we tried to take it seriously, but it got hilarious as the movie progressed. How many rounds can you shoot with a gun? Kill hundreds of people and not get hit by a bullet even once? Rolling down a 222 steps high stone staircase while hitting your head many times and then walk right up again to kill whoever is in the way? And a blind man who knows how to hit his opponents every single time, be it with a gun, a pistol or whatever. He even knows how to play cards and knows exactly which cards he puts on the table?

And then the sweet lips almost pressed against a 50's looking microphone keeping the swarms of hitmen, that all seemed to be tuned in on the same radio frequency, informed about the whereabouts of their mark? In how many movies did we see this before?

We could laugh about it all, but think about all these youngsters who take this as a possible reality: shoot everybody who is in your way and shoot as many people as you can. Seeing Mr. Wick as their role model in this brainless violence tsunami.

Well, I guess playing a role like that pays well. But still there are people in the States asking ""Why is it that we have so many (school) shootings in our country?"" Maybe Mr. Reeves has an answer to that.",3
eladron,"If you gonna see only one action movie this year- go to see john wick 4.

Non stop thrilling physical action, the additional martial arts masters / actors scott adkins and donnie yen definitely takes stuff to the next level.

Donnie is always amazing, im huge fan of him from his honk Kong movies, here he pays a homage to his role on star wars rogue one, and there's also cute homage to guardian of the galaxy with Klaus, brilliant guest appearance by the berlin berghain legendary bouncer that only says ""i am Klaus"" at one of the funny moments. The movie doesn't leave the humor out and there's lots of laughs in between the fighting.

Scott adkins doing a funny and effective role of a bodyguard with nine lives. And there's also a dog fighter!

Keanu is amazing as always as wick, the man that of you throw away from the door he will jump on you from the window.

The plot moves fast, the fight in the middle of the highway is unbelievable and there's lots of jackie chan style stunts that I never saw in a western movie. Maybe consider bringing him to chapter 5.

One of the best action/ martial arts film ever made.",10
t-muscat8,"John Wick 4 is an incredible addition to the action franchise. The film takes the series to new heights with even more intense fight scenes and a thrilling storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Keanu Reeves delivers another outstanding performance as the iconic hitman, and the supporting cast brings their A-game as well. Without giving away any spoilers, I can confidently say that John Wick 4 exceeds all expectations and is a must-see for fans of the series and action movie lovers alike

it's the best John wick and all of the characters that are added do an amazing job beat villains.",10
vjspyjwpr,"This is by far the worst of the 4 John Vick movies. It doesn't explain much to the viewers about what is going on and why. As in the other Vick movies the hero kills and kills, in many scenes they have so many killers coming at him and shooting that it would seem to be impossible for him not to get shot. He does wear Kevlar suits but Kevlar suits do not cover his whole body and Kevlar generally will not stop bullets from long barreled weapons such as assault rifles which are in use throughout the movie. In a 'shoot 'em up' movie like this the viewer has to suspend belief and just enjoy the action but the writer(s) and director took too many liberties, the movie isn't believable - even with suspended belief. At 2 hrs and 45 minutes, this movie is way too long, to fill that time they included long scenes of killing bad guys and it gets very repetitive and tedious. You should skip this movie, it's not worth 2 hr and 45 minutes of your life.",2
tarikibric,"So i watched the movie in IMAX. The beginning blew me away already, punch after punch my head felt like it wanted to explode in the first minute of the film, whole Theater vibrated and set the mood for the rest of the movie. The action and fight scenes are incredible. My jaw dropped almost every five minutes into the action, creative teamwork and deaths. Good acting, and after all this seriousness, there are some funny moments as well that got a chuckle out of me. Incredible locations and mood switches, intense moments combined with the IMAX system was just so dope. Of course there were some unrealistic moments where a normal human would have been dead already, but it is a movie, so they got to keep Mr. Wick alive somehow.

Would recommend!",8
User145111,"Another John Wick film, another unbelievable shooting fest. Unbelievable in the sense that one cannot believe how useless and incompetent everyone in the film is. Apart from the eponymous John Wick of course.

Every single goon/henchmen in this film acts as though they've never held a gun before in their lives. They constantly run out of cover, fail to react to anything happening in their surroundings and have precisely zero survival instinct. In this world John Wick is a legend. Everyone has heard of him and act as though he is the devil himself due to his skill and willpower. One would think then that the goons would know not to get close to him due to his grabbing, grappling and gun-fu abilities. Nope. They will happily run around without a care in the world acting as though they practically wish for death.

You know how everyone in this universe has a bulletproof suit? Maybe aim for the head every so often. Or, just flail around and allow for your attacks to ping off of John Wick's torso.

It's incredibly distracting. Reeves just seems tired to the point of taking Wick's melancholy, stoic personality to new levels of boring. Fair play to him for being the age that he is and committing to the stunts as much as he does. If only the fight coordinators could muster similar levels of enthusiasm for their work.

Blind Donnie Yen makes no sense.",1
mike_morais_15,"The only two parts I loved about the movie was at Berlin with the fat German guy and at New York's library. The rest of the movie was a parody of the firsts movies: John gets run over by cars, falls from buildings, gets stabbed multiple times and gets back up immediately like it was nothing. Also they keep making fun of the fact that John Wick has no motives to keep going. Then we have a blind Mr. Chow that almost did what hundreds of highly trained assassins with vision couldn't do all together. We have a ton of repeated action scenes from the previous movies and even in the actual movie. For exemple, why bring another assassin with a dog? They couldn't thought of another animal? Why not a bird or something? And the casting of the Marques? The actor is just a french baby. Not intimidating at all... To conclude, I was expecting more realistic scenes, more real motives for John to be angry against the High Table, more charismatic characters like the German fat guy and more original fighting scenes( like in the other movies where he goes from a arms museum to a horse stable üòÇ).",5
hansolo111,"I can think of no other series of movies that consistently improves upon itself than the John Wick series. This fourth installment improves even upon the fantastic third movie. The action sequences are unparalleled and the martial arts sequences are, as always, phenomenal. I agree with my fellow reviewers that this is definitely one of the greatest action movies ever made - as were they all. It is clear that the Director and Production Team really put a lot of effort into pushing the boundaries of action, and the location of Paris was used to maximum effect to produce some stunning action sequences. Make the effort to view this movie at the cinema, as you will get the full cinematic experience that this film needs to show all of the work put into it.",9
alexpkimel,"John Wick: Chapter 4 sucked. Here's why.

1. The characters. Caine is not interesting. There's no way a hitman could be blind and competent at their job. Even for John Wick, a series where the main character can survive multiple gunshots, it's unrealistic. Caine did not have to be blind either. His character could have been a normal hitman and it would've been way more compelling. Plus, he's pretty flat as a person and doesn't have any personality traits. Killa was equally bad. His gimmick of being comically french fell extremely flat and he's pretty annoying. Mr Nobody served no purpose to the story as well.

2. The writing. There were plot holes upon plot holes. Even for a John Wick movie it was unbelievable 'Nough said.

3. The action was much worse than the other films in the series. John Wick is usually regarded as having realistic action in that the attacks and gun play the characters would do would be based in reality. This was not the case. Enemies take turns attacking John Wick and the hand to hand fight scenes were much less grounded in actual fighting techniques.

4. The movie was too long. That's it.

5. The beginning was pretty bad, much worse than the rest of the movie.",4
MovieRiffing,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is the culmination of the entire series and represents the perfection of all of the different ideas and concepts that have been toyed with up until now. The film's lengthy runtime flies by, with every second of it earned. It not only delivers top notch inventive action sequences, a Hotline Miami inspired climax which will leave you mesmerized, and a satisfying payoff to the earlier entries' elaborate world building, but it accomplishes all that with such visual and auditory style and finesse that it honestly sets a new standard for martial arts films moving forward.

pandapipsi,"I'll keep it short and simple. This movie franchise is literally Tugg Speedmans Scorcher with Tuggs trailers in the beginning of tropic thunder perfectly desicribing the plot of these 4 movies. Bad guy kills 100000 assassins and survives. Now he has to kill 100000 more guys to get to the bottom of this whole thing. Then some new villains try to get him and he must kill 100000 more guys. Then in 2023, he's BACK to kill more guys. And let's not fool ourselves, there will be a 5th movie because why not. People keep drooling all over themselves because ""action"". This movie currently sits at a 8.0 on imdb, 0.2 below a classic action flick like Die Hard. That is actually ridiculous.

At this point these movies are getting so silly I'm actually embarrassed to go watch another. I brought my girlfriend to the premiere of this movie and felt like a idiot the whole drive back because these movies have rid themselves of ANY meaningful dialogue, the script is actually objectively trash and the acting just isn't there. I was EMBARRASSED on the drive home from cinema. If this was any other movie it would get trashed, but because the first one was a pretty good revenge flick and because Reeves is so lovable this franchise gets a pass. I don't get how people parade this movie like some kind of awesome masterpiece when it's so obvious what a cash grab this is just riding on the back of the first movie. Do better.",1
spartin7,"Although this movie was not something for me, I was somehow still bored and underwhelmed.

I fell asleep 3 times during the course of this film and this is due to a number of reasons.

The story and dialogue of the movie are awful, and the only redeeming factor is the actions sequences, which are well shot and choreographed. However, the awful acting and.crappy dialogue held back this movie for me.

Sitting in the front row also hurt my viewing experience. The story of this was essentially, then then then, rather than but therefore or good story structure.

Ch-Debus,"""I am Klaus."" If you know the guy who has this Cameo in John Wick: Chapter 4, you may realize the only funny moment in this movie. Besides that I neither understand the imdb ratings nor the critical acclaim. NOTHING in this movie amazes me because it offers nothing that one has not seen in cinema before and on several other occasions movies have delivered action in a more suspenseful, more fast paced action thriller. But John Wick: Chapter 4 rather feels like watching somebody running through an ego shooter but that is admittedly not very exciting. The senseless and emotionless action sequences without any proper tension make John Wick: Chapter 4 a very dull movie. Sometimes the degree of stupid violence is really hard to bear. Especially in times like these, it makes you wonder, does it need senseless action movies full of ultra violence. I think not and I am annoyed that I went to the cinema for this movie. A movie the world really does not need. The end of the movie creates hopes that an end is put to the John Wick saga but I am still in doubt that this is really the end. Unfortunately the John Wick series is too successful. And I do not know why. P. S. The Berlin club scene is really a joke and nothing compared to proper club sense like in movies like Collateral, Black Swan or else, even Blade is better than this even though Blade is 25 years old.",2
Sunsphxsuns,"John Wick Chapter 4 is everything you'd want from this tremendously popular franchise. I would describe it as pure ""choreographed aggression,"" like a delicate ballet. But instead of Swan Lake, this is all about bullets and knives. Incidentally, don't trouble yourself with a body count. The sheer number and intensity of ""kills"" will truly elude you.

JW4 rather nicely returns for a riot of startling violence tempered by a melange of perfectly cerebral philosophical moments. Unlike the sardonic ""ultra violence"" of Stanley Kubrick's, A Clockwork Orange (1971), JW4 is sensibly raw, with just enough creepy humor to keep you from completely jumping out of your own skin.

It doesn't hurt that JW4 has a great cast. Reeves immediately sells Wick & company's dark commitment with a raw emotion somewhat reminiscent of a Clint Eastwood Western. The massive emotional exhaustion which unfolds simply adds more gravity to this newest Chapter. ""Sauce for the goose,"" one might say.

Flaws? Very few. And JW fans won't care. This is what makes cinema so FUN, especially now that we're all feeling some relief in this post-pandemic world. JW4 is heavy, exciting, and has plenty of authentic action. You will NOT be disappointed!!!!",10
ecsecs-91225,"Starts out great then crash n burns halfway through. True to form and early on we have great cinematography, tense stare downs, witty dialog, diverse fighting styles well choreographed. Attention to detail, like having to re-load or dealing with injuries (case in point, if your hand gets cut in half you ain't pulling a trigger or getting in a fist fight any time soon). The travel of John Wick going from point A to point B should always be an action packed unpredictable blood bath. All changed as this movie progressed. One can only assume ill-timed social distancing requirements and lazy production habits currently plaguing Hollywood started taking hold. Mr Wick, who typically has to fight through anonymous bounty hunters mixed in with crowds, no longer a problem. Plus Wick is showing up everywhere, Tokyo to NY to Berlin to Paris with zero explanation of how he got there. In prior installments arrangement to go to NY cost him a finger and he got branded just to secure passage to Casablanca. Fight scenes and gun battles, all loosing their timing and explosive choreography...halfway through replaced with tricky camera angles and flash lighting to hide the shoddiness. They establish a blind assassin using sensors to track enemy movement in close quarters (very cleaver), but all of a sudden he can bullseye gunshots at distance unassisted? The car chase scene through Paris, looked like it was shot on an original iPhone. Most obvious, running out of bullets stopped being a problem. Why? One of the cool things about John Wicks previous gun battles were the slick way he acquired ammo and reloaded. Eliminating that aspect was just plain lazy. All that aside I'm forced to agree with many, the gun battle with the exploding shotgun shells with a top down ceiling view, ingenious! Admittedly it was done so well it's how this movie got three stars instead of one.

Still we have a contradictory plot enhanced by flip flopping character motivations. Comparing what came before, in every action sequence you always knew who was for or against Wick. His allies, enemies, old friends, fanatical fans, were unwavering no matter how how they felt personally. As this movie progressed you didn't know from one punch or gun shot to the next who was going to be on who's side.

Note to the producers, if you're going to place Wick in the most crowded cities on earth you have to have swarms of people around, not just 2 or 3 like you're watching a staged play. You'll never see just two people on Tokyo subway train or walking through central park. It does nothing but take you right out of the movie.",3
A_Different_Drummer,"Given the sad state of Hollywood output these days, this is one of the better offerings. But it does require some suspension of disbelief. You have to believe that 58 year old 175 lb Reeves is a dangerous man. And that sorta works. You also have to believe that this franchise was strong enough to merit at least 3 sequels. Jury still out there. And, most important, you have to believe that the key to making a good film from an essentially weak and over-done premise is to extend it to 3 grueling hours, and throw lots of money at it. Donnie Yen steals every scene he is in, and makes you wonder if his semi-retirement from Asian films was really a good idea? And the writers have stolen tropes and tricks from a handful of prior productions including KUNG FU (wise sayings); MY NAME IS NOBODY; VANISHING POINT (radio overlay); THE BLIND SWORDSMAN; THE GAUNTLET; and of course the first 3 movies in the series. The one quote that best applies here was left out of the script -- ""in the realm of the blind, the one-eyed man is King"". ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

rehmankhilji,"Yes, this edition, perhaps intending to be last, the director and makers decided to go all out. By all out i mean, 3 hours of non stop action, i meant it, the entire movie, nothing but just killing, blood, fights, falls, kills, kills and more kills.

It was like John Wick was in a video game mode, where he was playing on easy level, by this i mean he get hurts very rare and recovers very quickly.

I loved the first part to be all fair, it has a that touch, but as the parts came, everything was enhanced and in this one, there are no limits. It has more fight scenes then any Kung fu movie, where they even eat while doing Kung Fu.

But its John wick so since watch the first three, see this one for the routine.

P. S.

Dont know how long it will take Neo to understand that Morpheus is nothing else but trouble.",5
latinfineart,"I wonder what percentage of the people who are raving about this film are adults. My guess would be a minority. And the adults who love this film are also likely Marvel fans, so they are willing to suspend any need for credibility. I think the aspect I found most offensive, was the arm plates, which ALWAYS stopped incoming bullets, no matter what angle they were coming from, the caliber of the weapon, or any other scientific factor.

This film was very poorly written. The sets, the cinematography, the lighting was spectacular. I only watched it for the production values, having tuned out this franchise after the 2nd film.

The fight scenes were interminably long, and 100 levels beyond preposterous. Most of this film was ridiculous. Very dumb stuff. If you can dumb yourself down, you might enjoy it more than I did.",3
stevendbeard,"I saw John Wick: Chapter 4, starring Keanu Reeves-the Matrix movies, Dracula_1992; Donnie Yen-the Ip Man movies, Shanghai Knights; Shamier Anderson-Awake, Wynonna Earp_tv and Bill Skarsgard-the It movies, Atomic Blonde.

I love the John Wick movies and they just keep getting better as they go along. The action is off the charts, the stunts are better than ever, and just when you think there is nothing new to see in a fight-or car chase-Baba Yaga will surprise and shock you. Keanu returns for maybe his last ride as John Wick, at least according to how this one wraps things up-but, I'm sure Keanu still has another one or two left in the tank. Bill plays the Marquis, a sort of big shot in the High Table organization that wants Keanu dead. Donnie plays an old friend of Keanu's that Bill forces to hunt Keanu. Shamier is another hired gun that Bill gets to join in on the hunt. Shamier is called the Tracker and has a highly trained dog that tag teams Shamier in fights-on voice commands. All Keanu wants is to get his freedom back and his name cleared. He learns of a loop hole in the High Table rules and focuses all his abilities on reaching that agenda. One of the fight sequences on a flight of stairs is very entertaining and the car chase in Paris is unbelievable-kudos to the stunt people. Make sure you don't leave the theater too soon because there is a scene after the end credits that involves a characters' fate and there is a dedication after that to Lance Reddick-he died March 17 2023-who played the hotel concierge, Charon.

It's rated R for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 49 minutes.

I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",10
coachcritch-531-770221,"Wearing. Killing. Killing. Killing. Mostly by judo tossing the opponent to the ground and shooting them in the head at close range. Over and over and over to the point of absurdity. Wick falls two stories onto concrete, gets up and brushes himself off like Jake Blues. Dog gets hit head on by a car at 80 mph, flies 25 yards, gets up and just growls. Just absolutely ridiculous. Anti-cerebral trash for the simple minded. If you watch the first 15 minutes, you've seen all you need to see. Best part was driving home with my adult son and laughing at how stupid everything was. Was glad when it ended. We were both concerned at the good reviews it's receiving. Concerned for our society.",3
MamadNobari97,"From the beginning, the movie feels like it's from another franchise and made by another director. Though I will say that I actually liked the beginning of the movie and was gonna say that it is surprisingly going really fast for a 3-hour movie and I might not feel the runtime at all, but boy was I wrong. It was also kinda weird that we stayed in the same location for the first hour of the movie, but they introduced more gorgeous locations throughout the movie and it's one of the aspects I liked about it. Nevertheless, you Will feel the runtime in this movie.

First of all, from all the overwhelmingly positive reviews from both critics and the audience, I was thinking ""Finally, seems like they've learned from their mistakes with the 3rd one and made the best one in the franchise"", and boy was I wrong big time again. I can certainly say for sure that for me personally, this is the least I've been invested in and enjoyed a John Wick movie. I didn't even like 3 that much since it was so long and the action scenes were drawn out for too long, but this somehow managed to double down on the problems of the 3rd and it is even worse than 3 for me and the worst of the franchise. I will at some point rewatch this to see if I changed my mind and I enjoyed it better, but as of now, if I wanted to rewatch a John Wick movie, the 2nd one would be at the top of the list and this one would be at the bottom.

I know it's dumb to go watching a John Wick movie expecting a plot, and no, I'm not asking for a Chinatown level of plot and storytelling, but maybe a little plot wouldn't hurt? I know that this series has had barely any plot in any of the movies, but at this point, only action scenes can't really carry a nearly 3-hour movie, they just can't, especially when the action (minus the Hotline Miami sequence) gets too repetitive and boring as the movie goes on. The 3rd tried it and I somehow prefer the action scenes of that one to this, because I think there were still more unique action scenes in that one despite them getting longer and longer as the movie went on like this one.

This movie definitely has unique set pieces and I like the different locations, the Hotline Miami scene is awesome and the Paris square scene with cars is the highlight. But they all have something in common which gets somewhat annoying at the end: everybody having bullet-proof suits and keep covering their heads with it and not dying. At first, I thought it was really cool and I didn't have a problem since it was established in the second and the third movie. But when each and every action scene throughout this nearly 3-hour movie has 30 people who are basically John Wick from the second movie and every one of them takes 500 bullets to die, it is boring and repetitive.

John himself takes more hits than Steve Rogers himself throughout the MCU and survives somehow all of them that you'd think Marvel copied Punisher from this guy.

Getting back to the plot, I understand that the story isn't that much different than the second one, but my problem is exactly that the plot shouldn't be this thin for a 4th movie in the franchise. The first movie had a bare-bones plot too, but the reason it was good, was that the movie knew when to end and not take 3 hours to tell a nothingburger of a story. It was a breath of fresh air at the time and reminded us what actual choreographed action scenes can and should look like. It also had realistic action and people actually died. John Wick redefined the genre and it was synonymous with ""realistic action"", but as the series went on, it became less and less realistic, and in my opinion, for the worse and not better.

The second one expanded on the lore and gave another thin plot, but it still was still enough to carry the whole movie and the action scenes were amazing. By the third movie, they started to think that more is better, but forgot about ""too much of a good thing"". If you trim the 3rd movie, you could have another amazing John Wick movie with fantastic and creative set pieces and action sequences. But as it stood, it was too long and the third act was too repetitive with John and Charon killing bad guys and going back for more ammo and guns and killing more bad guys and doing that for 30 minutes straight.

But this movie is just on a whole other level of bloated runtime and too-long action scenes and having too much of a good thing. It is fair to say I am disappointed with how they handled this movie and its non-existent story and made not care about the characters and most of the action. The movie has definitely some of the best action you will ever see in any movie, no doubt. But it is unfortunately too long, there is barely any plot and the whole movie just feels weird. It feels like a video game (not in a good way like Hardcore Henry) with no story and you just kill goon after goon without dying to get to the final boss.

It just feels pointless and I feel really nothing about it, don't really feel empathy for John, nor do I really hate the villain because I'm not that invested. I hated Santino and wanted to see him die so badly in the second movie because they did a good job of making you invested in the story too, but here? I just don't care that much and I don't even care that much about the action scenes either since most of them have invincible enemies that won't just die with one headshot, they need 30 other shots in every inch of their bodies and even then, they might come back again.

Again, I loved all the different locations and the set pieces they had, I liked so many small moments from the different action scenes, and I thought Scott Adkins' character was really fun and reminded me of Batman's Penguin and the whole sequence with him was really cool, engaging and fun. But the movie is just too long for its own good and has barely enough story to support it. They don't really expand on the lore of this universe other than ""everybody has bullet-proof pajamas now"" and the sprinkle of some backstory for John Wick's family is not enough.

If they had managed to somehow mix the 3rd and 4th movies to have an actual plot and have the third act of the 3rd one be the first act, and the rest would've been this but shorter, then it would've even warranted a runtime over 3 hours and I wouldn't've been bored this much and this movie didn't feel so pointless to me. Because I do think this movie doesn't justify its existence at all. It feels like a parody of John Wick and a 4th movie that was given to a worse director. It also doesn't help that there are so many obvious CGI backgrounds that get really noticeable as the movies go on and make it look weird and cheap somehow.

People saying this is the best action movie ever made is really funny to me when Raid 2 still exists. That series too had a first movie with basically zero plot, but the second one definitely upped the game in every aspect and had plot+action and the runtime didn't hurt. I don't think this movie's action is even that much better than the 3rd which is saying much, let alone John Wick 2 and Raid 2. And like I said, yes, the Hotline Miami scene is one of the best in the series and them fighting between the cars was really good, but as a whole package, John Wick 3 has better action and more rewatch value than this all day.

My rule for the repetitiveness of seasons of a show or installments in a movie series is that if the first one is really good and brings something unique and has its own identity, then cool. The second season/movie, if it repeats the same thing season one did and doesn't further the story or lore, then it's still not that bad and let the writers cook, it's just the one time they're trying to ride off the first one's success and copy it, surely they get better in the third season/movie and improve upon it. But if the third one is just doing the same thing and there's no progress, then I have a problem with it. (Looking at you Westworld). Now imagine a 4th season/movie where the whole thing feels like a filler episode and a damn long one at that. I simply just can't not get bored when you throw action scene after action scene and make it obvious that you had already run out of ideas two movies ago but you still kept going.

Overall, I am disappointed after expecting this one not to make the same mistakes as the 3rd one from all the positive reviews. There is barely any plot in this and yes, the majority might not care about it and just want a dumb fun action movie with good choreography and set pieces, and you will definitely get those. But for a movie with a runtime of up to nearly 3 hours, I expect some kind of character depth, characterization, and some plot to keep me invested and engaged. Keep the movie to 2 hours and I might like it a little more, but even with having the same problems as the 3rd one, it still isn't as engaging and rewatchable as that one. The action scenes are great but get too long and repetitive really fast. The movie feels like an imposter among the series and doesn't feel like it's made by the same team at all. I even forgot to mention the blind guy who is even more super than Daredevil himself and not even the best sniper in the world can take him out apparently. I didn't mind him at first, but the more we see of him, the more plausibility wants to walk out the door.

To sum it up, it's disappointing and it feels like a filler that shouldn't've been made. They should've just trimmed the 3rd movie a bit and finished the series there to have of the best and most consistent trilogies and action series ever, but I guess it's Hollywood and we can't have nice things.",6

aandac,"So I did not watch 1-3 of this installment, and was anxious I would not understand what's going on. So I watched the recaps on youtube and entered the cinema somewhat prepared. At least lore-wise. After 10mins in to the movie I suspected that the ""lore"" was just a bleak background for the sparse dialogues happening. After 20 min it became clear that this movie has no serious connection to anything worthwhile. Not even its own lore. The dog? No where to be seen. The car? Dunno. Dont want to spoil but there is nothing to spoil. Cut out the constant beating and shooting out of the movie and you get maybe 15 mins of lore. Its so boring, I cant understand the hype around John Wick. I just waited 180mins for him to finally finish.

I guess Keanu Reeves stopped acting and turned to gymnastics.",2
crosshatch,"Sure. A lot of action. But it really was quite...dumb. Sooooo much close range shooting and every one misses except the ""good guys""? C'mon. The acting was fair. Just the same John Wick as in every other John Wick movie. At this point, the movie has an 8.2 rating. I don't see it. This is Marvel superhero stuff. Hit by cars, shot, falling out of buildings and still...walking. Sorry, but a lot of action is great. But a lot of unrealistic, unbelievable action is for fantasies. It is as if all they wanted to do was pack in a bunch of Kill Bill killing times ten and call it an action movie. Long on blood, short on, well, everything else.",3
ajikude,"Totally overrated how was this an 8.2? There is alot action sure, the acting fluctuating between good and mediocre to laughable and woody. Some the action scenes are good but towards the end the action becomes monotonous and just plain ridiculous and repetitive almost slapstick comedy actions like Laurel and Hardy . There is just too much overacting in this movie... The steps fall scene near the end is just silly. There are some very flat scenes like the card game scenes. So the movie was overrated, didn't blow my mind and definitely I won't be watching this again ever.....I am glad I didn't pay to watch it.",2
Tweetienator,"Well, the first one was real fun and is still the real deal, the other two I can't remember much of but that there was a lot of shooting and fighting and running going on. John Wick: Chapter 4 just provides more of the same and I must state - I was rather indifferent and slightly bored while watching. Don't get me wrong - acting is sufficient, production fine, and there is a lot of action, but the story, well, all that blabla about the High Table and so on, is just redundant noise to set up the stage for different and exotic settings for more bumbum. I really think they should have left the first movie alone. That one is still cool and hot but like the Taken (Liam Neeson) movies with every added ""chapter"" the idea and quality of the story and character thins out. And last but not least, almost three hours running time is something like an overkill ;)",4

MogwaiMovieReviews,"It's not that I couldn't imagine there being four John Wick movies after I saw the first one, all those years ago, it's just I would have imagined them being straight-to-DVD Steven Seagal flicks, not global blockbusters.

But such was the charm of the first film: a dumb action movie much the same as any Jean-Claude Van-Damme video, but with first-rate world-building, care, attention and charm, and the best fight scenes seen in years. The two following films expanded the world but the story got worse, and here we are at last at the finale.

More than the others, this one has too many extraneous new characters introduced, padding out the screen-time and sidelining John Wick from his own movie. These are mostly fairly likeable and decently acted; they're just unnecessary, and clutter up the story with side quests no-one going in wanted to see.

The weakest actor is the Japanese girl playing Akira, although actually she may well be the best of them at performing the fight moves, which, early on especially, are nothing to write home about, look very obviously choreographed and rehearsed and go on much too long. The film could have been cut by up to an hour and it would have been better for it.

Keanu is looking a little stiff and frail and maybe ill, and there are long stretches in which he is not on the screen. And most of the time when he is he just stands around silent looking apologetic. By this point in the story, he's just depicted as an invulnerable superhero, and so the dramatic tension has greatly diminished: though some of the later fight scenes are inventive and well-plotted, they have no emotional weight or believability to make you buy into them. Hundreds of professional killers shoot at him and none of them even injure him, whereas he murders all of them with ease. This ends up very boring: you may as well be watching someone else play a video game.

For all the above griping, it's still a good old-fashioned action movie, and no worse than the previous one, but has little in it that would win over someone not already invested in the story from the first film.

5¬Ω/10.",5
kmyoutube,"I had some fun watching the film but I was disappointed quite often as well. I'll start positive. Keanu is kind of cool so that helped a lot. Now to some criticism. As others have mentioned, most of the fight scenes were choreographed so embarrassingly bad that I spent most of the film watching bad guys standing off to the side and waiting for their turn for John Wick to kill them. We see literally hundreds of trained assassins pointing and shooting high powered automatic weapons John at (who is usually standing out in the open) and yet non ever strike John. John falls flat on his face from the top of a building, gets hit 5 times by speeding cars,rolls down 6 flights of stairs after being pummeled relentlessly and in every case gets up almost none worse for wear. Even his suit never got dirty. At some points I accidentally laughed out loud.

A huge, huge plot hole was the radio announcer stating John's every move and update (including the increasing bounty money for killing John Wick). There was never any indication how they received the information instantaneously or why all the assassins happened to be listening to the radio at the same time. Who listens to radio now anyway?

The ending!?! Did he die? Did I miss it? One minute he's shot but still walking, talking needing a little rest and bath. The next scene shows his tombstone. Totally disappointing vague ending.

I had no idea how long the film was. It actually went fairly quickly although most of the fight scenes were double the length I felt they needed to be.",6
hanschsolo,"While John Wick 4 points with extraordinary beautiful cinematography and some well-made action sequences, it fails apart at two key points when it comes to movies for me.

Firstly the plot. What is this even about? Who knows. People care for the action. But why do we then need to watch more than one hour of build-up for the action, you could watch the action without understanding what is going on, you don't need to know why these people fight, there is no conflict, and even if there is, it doesn't matter, because it has no consequences to the plot. The problem is that the plot is only sequenced trough talking, no visual language.

That makes the movie feel like a video-game. The action-scenes are the one you interactively play, and the talking scenes are just long cut scenes. This Formula works for many games, but you can skip those cut-scenes. If it's a good game, the gameplay will make your blood rush and you will not care for that dialogue pause. Best example is Hitman, you don't care for the story, you just want to play.

What is John Wicks Goal? I as a Viewer, gather nothing from the motivation of revenge, since the first movie the goal is the same, and it doesn't carry the weight of the first one. He does this all because of the last present his woman gave him, because of a dog. And while the film could dive into wicks character and analyze his psyche, and his former relationship to his woman, because she's the reason of this all happening, It rather focuses on an old friendship that now turned into an rivalry. I want to understand this man, and empathize with him, but the movie simply doesn't care about it's character work and the plot.

Secondly the Pacing. It takes too long for the action to begin, and when it ends, it again takes take long until it begins again. A Simple process. And if the story is not compelling enough, it's hard to get trough.

I feel like people are getting easier to please within every year and call everything a masterpiece. People seem to go crazy for mindless action without any substance. Without any conflict and emotion. It's nothing new. It's nothing we didn't had 20 years ago.

Yes, the Action is good filmed. The lighting is great, but what does it really matter? Is an good action flick really what we need more of nowadays. The genre is oversaturated. It has no weight anymore for me. Filmmakers need to try and do something fresh. I do not want to turn of my brain during a movie.

After one and an half hour during the movie passed, I asked myself an Important Question during the movie.

What was the intention of John Wick 4? It was not a Vision the director wanted to show us, because there is no vision. Most importantly, there are no emotions. Nothing to move the audience with. There is no art behind this. Even if it's well made, this whole movie feel feels like an ad.

So now, I know exactly what the intention of John Wick 4 was. It was Money.",2
Niebel,"A friend from my poker game invited me to go with him to see this film. I was stunned. It came very near getting my rating as the stupidest film I ever saw, though, in the end, I decided ""The Blair Witch Project"" should keep that title.

The guy must have killed a hundred people in the story, almost all of them with one quick snap shot with a handgun, while all of them were shooting at him, sometimes with submachine guns, but never managed to hit him!

It is astounding to see such films attracting an audience, and sickening to see the high ratings given to it by contributors to this forum. Sad, so sad!",1

jonathan_m_woods,"Its also ridiculous,. Outrageous, ludicrous, and hilarious. They have uncut action scenes that last for minutes now. Easily the overall best action stunt movie for the art. Simple story and Wick indestructible. But so worth it. Fighting up an endless staircase against innumerable foe to the music of Justice. Bravo. The most imaginative chorography fight scenes I have ever seen. They push the limit, the intensity, the absolute insanity how can it not be the perfect action movie created.

idodge51,"I didn't care about any of the characters. The world felt like a slumber dream. What is real, what is not. Action was poorly choreographed. Had no realistic element. I was so tempted to pick up phone or just leave, I've never done either, but also never been so tempted. I think if you are 13 years and this might be action-porn for you. The first John wick was solid, this was not.

There is scene where something happens to John and that was funny. I don't think it was supposed to be funny. But I was too frustrated with whole film. There is scene which shooted from the ceiling and that felt like a game... idc to write anymore.",2
robertellis-98724,"I go into a movie like this not expecting amazing writing, dialogue, etc but for the cinematography and action scenes.

John Wick Chapter 4 has some of the best shot action sequences I have ever seen on film. It also has some of the worst I've ever seen. There is a legitimate 40 minute action sequence near the opening of the film that had me begging for something else to happen. Then just as John is leaving, more goons show up and the fight just starts all over again...

I have very mixed feelings about this film as the effort and style oozes off the screen from beginning to end. Some of the performances were even really good between the action scenes. The cinematography can be incredible! The opening sequence and shots of the sunset are beautiful. But it all means nothing if there is no substance behind it.

The film's length is another serious problem. It is unjustifiable. I've seen these movies compared to games in the past, and as an avid gamer, I've never understood the criticism until now.

Everything about this movie is a video game in all the worst ways possible: Stretching out content by putting meaningless side content that could easily be cut for a more meaningful story, just added to include more repetitive gameplay sections. Bullet spongey enemies that always miss their shots and fall with little to no thought. A main character that could survive a nuclear explosion if he covers his head with his suit jacket??? Falling from 50 foot drops that instantly kill characters that are not the main character. Hell, the last movie at least made it seem like the fall damage he sustained at the end required him to rest and recover...

I know this is meant to be a ridiculous fun rolllercoaster ride, but once you do one loop de loop having another 20 on same ride with no break in between does not sound like fun to me.

The pacing of the action scenes in this film somehow manage to make the idea of a blind man with a sword in his cane, being able to snipe people using motion tracking doorbells incredibly boring.",2
tairikuokami,"Exceptionally boring, there is nothing going on throughout the whole movie. 1 was great, then it turned into James Bourne, he was merely running away, no story whatsoever. I give it 3 because of great actors and the loyalty, otherwise I would rate it as 1. The CGI dog flying over the cars was just the cherry on top.

Even if you do not know, how it ends, you can easily guess it, they introduced some supposedly logical twist using their precious rules made up as they go, which did not occur to them for the whole 3 movies before.

I was looking forward to this movie, but it was a total disappointment.",3
horst69,"How bad can fight scenes be?

It depends - they can be poorly done, or they can be poorly implemented into the movie.

In this case, it's a bit of the former, and all of the latter.

More specifically - the fight scenes have a few seconds of brilliance here and there, but in general they are mediocre, repetitive, and drawn out to the point of becoming boring halfway through each of those scenes.

Filming and editing are equally uninspired, only doing the basic task of capturing stereotypical action choreography and worn out effects.

Even worse, the action gets in the way of what little story there is; this film has moments when a coherent and convincing tale is showing through - like there's an actual movie, desperately trying to get out.

But to no avail; inevitably yet another endless tedious action scene will have you reach for the forward key.

Many missed opportunities, like the brilliant idea of that one 'unique' hitman, which then was so poorly executed.

Action movies, fight scenes, they've been mastered ages ago; of course by many of the better martial arts movies from the East, or Western films like Kill Bill.

What they have in common is a sense for proportion, balance, timing and rhythm - this flick only piles one cheap thrill on top of another, and another, and so on to the point of exhaustion.

It's unfortunate the creators chose to completely abandon the recipe of the first two John Wick movies, which were very decent.

On a positive note: John Wick 3 was even worse re. All of the above; but a heavy dose of confirmation bias might have made the creators of this sequel ignore its predecessors' obvious shortcomings.",2
Byron1c,"So, there is currently a writers strike, and after the slew of awful movies with appalling writing and stories, Im hoping a lot of people get fired and some new writers (or much older ones who retired) get hired.

This is a classic example - I have no idea what the story of this movie is, beyond ""kill the bad guys"", with lots of traveling around in between awesome action sequences.

The first few movies had very basic stories, but there was something to them at least, motivations that you could get behind, but this has next to nothing.

I skipped through the last 20 minutes, watched some of the action, which got tedious after awhile - the same kills over and over with some boss fights that were interesting.

Even the script was pretty predictable with the one liners and quips being so cliched that you could quote them without having seen it before.

Even poor Lance Reddick didn't get much of a send off, which was disappointing too.

Keanu Reeves and Donny Yen were fantastic of course, but they can only do so much with a nothing story.",5
rpelleschipa,"Ridiculous. Bullet proof clothing? Really?? And that stair scene. Really? I realize there is a certian amout of suspention of dissbelief when it comes to most movies but this one is off the charts. When I seen 8.3 stars on IMDB I was excited to go see it. I almost walked out and I can never remember doing that before. Little to no real plot. Just shooting and fighting to the point of boredom and I loved the first one. I like a good action movie but come on. I would not go to see John Wick 5 which I am sure will be out there Just like Fast and Furious 57 or whatever number thier up to.

It appears there is no real thought anymore in Hollywood. Wayyy too mant sequals with no original ideas for new movies. I guess thats why I rarely go to the movies anymore.",2
pbranco-17370,"There's such a thing as too much. I know this is an action movie but its literally just John Wick shooting people for 2hours and 49 minutes. He never gets hurt, he falls from 30 meters and doesn't break one finger, pretty sure he shoots around five hundred people and he doesn't get one single scratch. There is no story line, it is just shooting and non sense. I dont understand how so many people like this movie, its one of the worst movies I've ever watched. I'm glad this sequel is over so I never need to waste 3 hours of my life watching John Wick's non sense. Very disappointed, they could have ended so much better!",2
mickgibbo23,"Is this watchable? Yes. Is it better than another bland Marvel movie? Yes. Its not a bad film, its John Wick but longer. The problem for me is the bullet proof suits. Everybody has them. People get shot point blank and just keep on about their business. It makes the action boring to watch. Theres never any risk to being shot at. How many times does John Wick just walk forward doing the same repetitive moves with his jacket covering his face? Too many. The bit on the steps is boring and we basically have to watch it twice. I'm all for a big action movie that looks nice and has a big, diverse cast but the bullet proof suits just take away any sense of drama. He just becomes a bullet sponge and it becomes boring. For all the spectacle, some parts felt like watching somebody playing a video game. Also, Hollywood needs to stop making Donnie Yen blind in movies.",6
icullenengineer,"As a big fan of Mr Reeves (the replacements is his acting apex in my opinion, point break best overall movie) it pains me to rate this even at 4 stars.

There is essentially zero plot.

Close quarter action sequences dilute this movie to the point of being irrelevant. There is zero plot (I know, please bear with me) evolution with this story, hashed out dialogue that would make James Corden blush, cameos that feel like they're there for no other reason than to create a TV spinoff and cinematography that would make any film school graduate turn in their future grave.

You know how you watched the fast and the furious film up until 9 and then went ""naaah that's enough, I'm done""... you'll reach that point with this movie. Watch the first one and bedo e with how good it was....remind me of another Keanu franchise!!",4
mdhatmustafa-92765,"Seriously, guys?... All that hype... For this!... I don't know why everyone is praising this movie... Maybe because it's the first "" masculine "" movie in a while... I'm with you on that... Can't even remember the last male lead movie out there lmao... But seriously, it's the worst out of the John Wick movies...long story short... It's a filler movie... Total lacklustre... The movie is unbelievably empty and predictable...most of the scenes are literally identical....maybe because there's literally nothing happening other than fighting! ... No story or events .... The movie is only somewhat watchable because the cast is awesome and charismatic! ...some of these guys are like 60 but they're killing it... Anyway... Another let down....so, let's see.... operation fortune.. Wack... Bullet train... Waaack... the John Wick finale...Sadly... also wack... Let's hope Mission impossible is gonna be different....and if you want a nice action flick to watch... I recommend wrath of man... Trust me it's good...

PotassiumMan,"Intensely engaging, immensely satisfying and courageously anguished, this John Wick chapter delivers the goods and then some. It's a testament to the durable potency of a well-executed, non-formulaic action film. There's so much raw vitality here, that one will barely notice the running time.

Keanu Reeves never loses his power or presence as the former hitman who once again faces an imposing army of antagonists and pursuers even as he plots his own course of payback. Although some action sequences can be a little protracted, in the end, they achieve lasting and memorable power on account of this director's knack for innovative camerawork.

This time around, John Wick's globetrotting work puts him in the crosshairs of the Marquis Vincent de Gramont, a cold-blooded member of the High Table. Their rivalry becomes a fierce battle that is waged at first in Osaka then Berlin and then throughout the streets of Paris. It's an opulent, labyrinthine showdown that we don't get to see very often in action films. Lush, colorful settings adorn the violence and bloodshed, almost as if to have to the physical beauty bely the depravity and carnage taking place.

Recommended to everyone, regardless of their preference or penchant for the action genre. Many modern action films are solely for action fans. This proves to be the exception.",9
ayaz-s,"Boy oh boy yet another one from the fantasy land, Rambo and Captain America incarnated into John Wick the super invincible figure.

How on earth do people and I mean so called grown ups still fall for this type of action movie is beyond my comprehension. If I was a ten year old kid maybe I would love the flash and bangs and be spellbound by the Disneyland story line hero.

Just because you kill a lot of people and move about a lot does not make one into a good actor and sadly it is in this category that KR falls into. If you have nothing and I mean absolutely nothing better to do even then I would caution everyone from watching this show which is an assault on your faculties. You definitely get up from this movie dumber than when you sat down to watch it.

Entirety of this movie is based upon imaginary action concocted by a kids mind where a mere mortal is untouchable by any bullet. Plot and story line are childish and pointless as far from reality as can be.",3
neyoneit,"I honestly have no idea who in the fresh hell rates this movie so highly. Why? For the love of God, why?

The fight scenes were slow, unrealistic, stupidly comical, and the blind man wins all the time in a world where assassins exist.

Don't get me wrong, the first John Wick was awesome, but the rest was pure poop, and this one was poop with a crown.

The CGI was extraordinarily bad. The fights don't make any sense. The story... oof, the story is something else. There were so many times anybody could have killed John that it's not even funny at this point. I had to fast forward at least 60 minutes of this movie; that's how bad those fight scenes were and how many opportunities there were for anybody to kill John. The assassin with a dog had several, not just one, but several occasions for a straight shot at John, but well, he couldn't kill John obviously because it would ruin the duel. What a poop show.

It's very sad to see John Wick end up like this, and it's baffling to me how anyone rates this dog poop so highly.",1
panagiotis1993,"I watched John Wick 4 in theater, not because I'm a huge fan or anything but because I wanted to not support Shazam fury of the gods. So let's start. The plot is super simple but really? It's not much. Once again we just have John Wick killing literally armies of people in all kinds of ways. I have no idea how many people he killed, I will probably check a YouTube video, I'm sure someone will make a kill count type video. I have to admit that some kills were very creative, even artistic you could say. I watch the John Wick movies more like a meme than an actual movie. Maybe you wonder why? Well let's face it, the main concept is absolutely ridiculous and doesn't make any sense. You have an old man who is able to fight non stop for hours entire armies and he never dies. When the movie started we had some really cool and creative fight scenes and I got very hyped but you get more and more and more and more fight scenes and the whole thing gets extremely repetitive fast and eventually extremely boring, i wanted to leave the theater at some point.

Most scenes are impressive and it's obvious that people worked really hard on them to make every scene and every kill feel intense and unique. I wish they took the time to have a little bit more plot / dialogue and less fights. But also many people love the John Wick movies for being exactly that, plotless and full of action, like super full. I still like the whole system of rules these people / criminals have and have to follow, like the ending with the whole cowboy-like scene was really cool, felt unique instead of having some really fast paced action scenes. I have to say that the acting wasn't really impressive. John Wick is an emotionless, almost robotic dude that shows no emotion and answers questions with 1 or 2 words. Also the main villain played by Bill Skarsgard, let's say it wasn't much. He didn't realy feel like a threat or a psychopath or anything. His scenes made me feel nothing or cringe. I don't know what went wrong, maybe wrong casting? This villain was ridiculous, an absolute fail. Hiroyuki Sanada was awesome though, I wish he had more screen time.

Something I really liked was the music choices with some really cool dark electro and ebm tracks playing. In my opinion if the movie had a little bit more story, more plot, more mystery even, this could have been a masterpiece. It's such a shame because with such good cast you could do great things. But right now to me it is just an ok movie which I don't think I will rewatch ever again. The end will have you believing that John is dead but im sure that if they want to bring him back, they can find many ways to do it. Conclusion: Impressive fight scenes, effects, music, editing, cinematography. Mediocre acting, non existent plot, needs more dialogue, extremely repetitive, boring at times. The John Wick movies don't deserve the hype they get for sure. Just plotless movies for people who want to watch a movie that looks exactly like a YouTuber's gameplay for a fighting / shooting game.

My rating for Chapter 3 was 5/10 but I believe that Chapter 4 is a bit better. My final rating is 6.2/10.",6
cinephilescientist,"This film is a masterpiece that takes action to the next level! When I first heard about it, I couldn't help but think of logic gaps, but hold on tight because this film hosts a record-breaking 10 kills per square meter in a single scene! The protagonist is truly a living legend, throwing action parties that span across continents.

The finale of the film is absolutely mind-blowing, but wait a minute! John Wick has taken such a beating that he looks like he survived an avalanche! If it weren't for these flaws, it would easily deserve a perfect 10/10, but due to these minor hiccups, I'll give it a well-deserved 9/10. Nevertheless, let's not forget that this film is still legendary!

Now, let's talk about the cinematography. The colors are explosive, as if they were on fire! The camera transitions are mesmerizing, almost like a dance with the action scenes. And the soundtrack fits the action sequences perfectly, as if the next fight song selection was a DJ's responsibility! This film is a treat for those who appreciate the art of action.

And I can't go on without mentioning one thing: Keanu Reeves! We love you, man! Your performance in this film was fantastic, and we thoroughly enjoyed getting lost in the world of action with you!

In conclusion, this film is destined to captivate action enthusiasts. If you don't dwell on the logic gaps, it offers a mind-bending and outrageously intense action experience. After watching this film, you'll find yourself expecting an action scene at every step, even in real life. Get ready for the ride of a lifetime!",9
david-meldrum,"Relentlessly long and with very few breaks in the action, the bladder-testing run time is not a major problem - several sequences could easily be cut with little threat to either what passes for plot or character development, but each individual sequence is so much fun that it seems almost churlish to criticise. As a whole it's almost the zenith of the influence of video games on action cinema; sequence after sequence carries the seemingly unending supply of gun fooder to the extreme of such games, and one stunning sequence, shot almost entirely from overhead, made me think of the first Metal Gear Solid game. The world-building continues apace - I'm pretty sure the lore of the John Wick world is being made up as they go along - but again it all happens with too much energy and fun for you to notice.",7
theffachrif,"Directed by Chad Stahelski, John Wick Chapter 4 continues the struggle of John Wick (Keanu Reeves) with the price on his head ever increasing, he finally uncovers a way to get free of The High Table for good. But he must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe.

Since this franchise started in 2014 with the release of its first movie, I'm in awe of how this franchise has come. I had no clue what they gonna bring in the final chapter since the last three movies always set the bar higher for the next, especially the action sequences. And somehow they still did it and I think it's a perfect culmination and the best movie probably not just in the franchise but also in modern action movies ever. The amount of story and action is quite perfectly balanced, it's kinda an improvement from Chapter 3 which I think is just endless action from the beginning. They also introduced a lot of exciting and interesting new characters each with enough backstory to understand their relationship with each other and their connection to the story.

Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsg√•rd, and Scott Adkins are simply phenomenal. Scott Adkins is almost unrecognizable in prosthetics and a fat body suit and we definitely need to see more of Bill Skarsg√•rd playing this type of role, he nailed it. The technical aspects are jaw-dropping, spanning from camerawork, stunning visuals and colors, and gorgeous cinematography to production and sound design. Some movies, especially action flicks definitely have one if not more memorable sequences, well John Wick: Chapter 4 is packed with over-the-top and memorable action sequences, the stunt choreography is truly flawless.

Salute to director Chad Stahelski for delivering the John Wick movies that were distinct from the others and closing them perfectly, he really saved the best for the last one (or there might be more). I'm excited to see where this franchise is gonna be taken next.

Don't let the length fool you, you won't feel it as soon as you hop in for an exhilarating adventure.",10
danchilton-71955,"John Wick Chapter 4 features another incredible physical performance from Keanu Reeves but not even he can defeat the twin villians of bloated runtime and extended universe nonsense.

The first act introduces a bunch of new characters to varying degrees of success. The most important is Donnie Yen as a blind former colleague of Wick forced out of retirement to hunt the protagonist down and the most fun is Shamier Anderson's ""Tracker"" who has a dog sidekick and is a prime candidate for a spin off. At the other end of the scale is The Marquis, the main villian of the piece. It's entertaining to see him pop up in ridiculously ostentatious locations throughout the film but his accent is ridiculous and any attempt at projecting menace is undermined by laughable dialogue. His response to a botched attempt to off Wick in a hotel is to say ""the goal was not to kill John Wick, it was to kill the idea of John Wick"", despite the fact the plan had definitely been to kill John Wick.

Wannabe cool dialogue falling flat on its face is a recurring theme throughout the stretched runtime. Lawrence Fishbourne spouts the same style of nonsense as he does in the previous films and while there is an attempt to flesh out the character of Winston (presumably with incoming series ""The Continental"" in mind) his attempts to impart sage wisdom just highlight the fact that, apart from Ian McShane's natural gruff cool, there isn't anything to him. Towards the end of the movie Wick embarks on a mad dash through Paris (a cool idea which probably should have been the whole film) but this too is suffers from a lame attempt at cool in the form of an obnoxious Warriors reference. What fits in a 70's New York gang flick jars in modern day Paris.

Chapter 4 does have some great action sequences, the stand out being a videogame inspired, overhead shoot out with Wick utilising a flamethrower shotgun and Reeves always shines when he is telling a story physically rather than through speech. The problem is there is just too much of everything. Too much rolling around shooting, too much using bullet proof jackets as a convenient way to extend fights and definitely too much high table, assassin tradition mumbo jumbo. Everyone likes to see John Wick do his thing, just not for nearly three hours.

5 traditions of phoney honour followed by 10 professional murderers.",5
husainfahim,"This movie was a classic john wick film.. Absolutely incredible plot of the movie. A few scenes including the one Killa Harken i think, the russian in purple suit were the best and most engaging scenes in the whole movie. The movie was definitely one of the best ive seen and it is going in my top 10. The fight scenes and the detail is seriously just amazing. The stunts Keanu Reeves has done for this film are incredible especially the driving scene where John wick has to drive the car on the wrong side of the road and also shoot with the other hand.. I have no words for the ending, it was just spectacular!!",10
alfredobarbozatellez,Same ol same ol nothing new through the entire movie and ending was more boring and dull. I almost feel asleep throughout this movie the other John wick movies were much better and believable. I'm just keeping it real this final movie if it is the final one was not as good as the first two and John wick just needed to make it more interesting more real there were some scenes were I was like this would never be in real life and why not add some better bad guy characters they looked like fruitcakes in this movie super soft .this was not what I was expecting and should have been better scripted and the fight scenes not overdone with the same ol same ol.,1
olcare,"First of all, I went to the cinema as soon as it came out and I must say that it should never be watched outside of the cinema. It's an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching. Its really really good action movie.

From a technical perspective, the film is phenomenal, especially the bird's-eye view scene. My mouth was wide open, it was amazing, and I couldn't get enough of the action. Every fight choreography was well thought out, yes, some parts were exaggerated, but it suited the pace very well. The staircase scene is the biggest example of making these long and single-shot action scenes aesthetic, and it's a great achievement.

In terms of acting, I think it was very good. Even though Keanu Reeves played emotionless at times, this role suits him very well. Especially there is one name that fits perfectly, Bill Skarsg√•rd, he played amazingly and I loved it. Also, Killa, played by Scott Adkins, was amazing. It was one of the most entertaining scenes I've watched in a long time, even though the fight with John was a bit weird, it was fantastic. I watched it breathlessly. I won't mention everyone individually, but the performances were more than enough from the stunt doubles to the one-scene actors.

It improves the action of the first 2 films and develops the lack of subject matter or subject matter presentation in the 3rd film, making a very aesthetic mix. They covered the biggest flaw in this series.

Also, another good thing was the harmony of the music to the scenes, every music was perfectly fine, which I think increased the pleasure of the action scenes by a click or two.

There is not much to say, it's a satisfying, exciting, and aesthetic film. Although it lacks emotionally at times, it never stands out and uses its time wonderfully. I loved the movie, and I highly recommend watching it in the cinema instead of waiting to watch it at home.",9
baumbach-86824,"Absolutely not the best of them. Maybe the worst. Painfully unrealistic, everyone wears literally bulletproof smokings and the elite guys were recruited out of gardeners, tax attorneys and university professors judging by their skill to kill with weapons. When in the first movie John shot each enemy a bullet in the head he now often feels the need to use 3 bullets (but sometimes they still stand).

As much as I enjoyed the very first John Wick movie as bored I felt during these extremely long and uninteresting fighting scenes. He is as immortal as Iron Man and with this leaves all excitement.

And it seems as if the directors were mocking the franchise by letting John fall out of the 4th floor, getting run over by cars, falling down literally 222 steps (I know because they mention it) of a staircase and all of it just leads to some short heavy breathing but it's forgotten just 3 seconds later.

None of the characters have personality. Keanus text was probably printed on half a page and mostly consists of 2 syllabus-responses or the name of the person he's just looking at.

I really like and appreciate Keanu as a person and actor. I just wish the director would have taken this movie serious. I wouldn't want to rewatch even 10 minutes of this letdown of a movie. And it makes me strongly think that most of those 9 or 10-star ratings are bought while I am writing this comment on the first opening weekend.",3
chand-suhas,"John Wick Chapter 4 is lengthy. By lengthy I mean it has an action packed first act followed a slower second act sans much action but makes up for it with the craziest final act where all hell breaks loose. John Wick after surviving the fall in the previous film, gets back to business of killing his way to freedom. The table has found a new head who pits John's friend against him. As the brutal fight resume, John is suggested a clever way out of this mess and how he pulls it off being an ex-communicado forms the story.

Donnie Yen's addition to the franchise takes the fourth film a notch higher, raising the bar for the stunts. The first act is indeed action packed and it flies by quicker than the bullets fired. The second act gets the story forward without much action until Scott Adkins shows up, which makes for a stylish action block with enough humor. The highlight is however the final act in Paris. The insane action sequence leading to the final fight gave me my money's worth and also covers up the generic weak villain which Bill Skarsg√•rd tries to make merry off.

It is indeed a fitting entry to the franchise and the first John Wick film to have an end credit scene, one has to sit through the end credits completely for that scene.",7
olcayozfirat,"The sequel, released in 2023. The movie is truly a visual feast. The scenes inside the apartment with the drone camera are amazing.

Donnie Yen was a great choice. We've been fans of Adam since the Ip Man series. He also showed a character with a personality.

Scott Adkins, on the other hand, made laughs in his brief role. What were those teeth? In addition, with such a fat image, he still made his own moves.

Again, there are plenty of weapons and artistic fighting actions. If you say illogical, from start to finish. My guess is it's over now. But the movie industry never knows. The movie is already box office guaranteed. They made us completely forget the last scene. The last scene was sad.

I think those who like fighting movies were happy to see interrelated actors. Donnie Yen vs Scott Adkins, Ip Man 4, Scott Adkins vs Marco Zaror shared their trumps in Undisputed 3.

Tracker character was so unnecessary in my opinion. I think what he added to the movie, nothing like its name. Also, the Bowery King's time and contribution was minimal. However, he also had a motive for revenge. Neither charisma nor weight remained in Winston's character.

I really felt sorry for Lance Reddick. He was the serious, law-abiding but conscientious face of the movie.

There is no sex or nudity in the movie.",7
hoernkeem,"Eric's Grade: B- 'John Wick 4' is the fourth film in the John Wick franchise all of which are directed by Stahelski. This is the first film of the series not to involve the creator of the franchise Derek Kolstand with the screenplay instead written by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch. Reeves reprises his now iconic role as John Wick seeking to make the High Table pay for the wrongs done to him. Ian McShane, Lance Reddick and Laurence Fishburne all return with the notable additions of Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsgard and Clancy Brown. Originaly slated for 2021 the production was delayed to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 'John Wick 4' was finally released in March of 2023 to generally positive reviews as well as box office success on par with the previous film. While the door remains slightly ajar for a potential fifth film this seems like the end of the line for the John Wick character for the foreseeable1 future.

This story finds John at once hunting the High Table as well as being hunted by them. To this end the High Table enlists Skarsgard's Marquis Vincent de Gramont, granting him unlimited resources, to dispatch Wick. He controls a veritable army of soldiers with a typical goon no. 1 at their forefront who is saved for an eventual showdown with Wick. Gramont also enlists Donnie Yen's Caine who is a reluctant servitor, but will do his duty to keep his daughter safe. Meanwhile Wick gets aid from familiar sources including the Bowery King and Winston. A new random player also hunts Wick as an unprecedented bounty has been placed on him. This new character is Mr. Nobody and played by Shamiar Anderson complete with attack dog companion which is very reminiscent of Halle Berry's character from the previous film. Despite the flood tide of bad guys thrown at John he wades through it broken and battered but still ready to fight for a final showdown with the Marquis at an appointed time and place for all the marbles whatever those marbles might be.

'John Wick 4' is super-sized clocking at at nearly three hours, and it feels bloated. Wick is getting it from all sides, and when the story begins I have a hard time understanding what he is actually trying to accomplish. Is he seeking revenge or absolution or just a way out? With the High Table after him all he does is put people in danger wherever he goes which is made abundantly clear in one of the first extended action sequences. This movie continues to play with this assassin subculture mythology they have created. Here it starts to get a bit more wonky as they seem to twist the mythology to accomplish the story rather than setting their story within a mythology. The action is intense and extended as one would expect. It is interesting that the first film made its name with a very economical form of stylized action, but as these sequels demand new and more intense sequences more emphasis has been placed on the stylized aspect of the violence losing the austere functionality that initially made it interesting. There are some superlative action moments, but mainly due to the settings rather than the action itself which becomes redundant simply due to sheer volume. You can feel them stretching to create different scenarios in order to not make it all feel the same. The production design and cinematography are sumptuous in this film and probably the best thing about the film as a whole. The addition of the Mr. Nobody character did not make much sense and just added run time. It felt like they really wanted some more non white representation, and just shoehorned in this superfluous character who I never really connected with and was constantly wondering why he was there. On the other hand I loved Donnie Yen and his off kilter somewhat nonchalant approach to his character.

If you enjoyed the other John Wick films there is enough here that you will enjoy this as well, but there is also the concept of too much of a good thing, and 'John Wick 4' enters that territory. The action just gets to be too much, and I found it hilarious as everyone is running around with these bulletproof suits which was a cool novelty two movies ago, but now becomes laughable as they shield themselves with their sportcoats like they are superhero capes. The movie has an overly long running time with a story that ultimately doesn't do anything with a more than ambivalent ending. The story itself didn't make sense for the character of John Wick. For two movies I have been waiting for him to go after this mysterious and seemingly unreachable High Table, and that battle never materializes except by proxy so based on that the plot was a disappointment. For what is supposed to be the final chapter I was just really hoping for something more. Something grand with an ending worthy of what this John Wick character has become, and I feel like the story they told here didn't do him justice and left the final chapter of his legacy begging for more.",7
Bosch,"Clocking in at a bladder-busting three hours, this fourth Johnny Wick movie from Lionsgate stubbornly sticks to the franchise's formula. The vague plot sees John Wick still on the run from the High Table, who have not only raised his bounty to $20 million, but also deconsecrates and destroys any Continental Hotel linked to John's movements. Cue a number of repetative action setpieces (all happening at night) that are separated by static dialogue scenes in which characters spout non-stop aphorisms, the first one being no less than Ned Kelly's ""Such is life.""

Delayed two years by the novel coronavirus pandemic, JOHN WICK 4 has Hong Kong martial arts cinema legend Donnie Yen co-starring as Zatoichi-style blind swordsman Caine, an old friend of Wick's. The supporting cast is filled out by Bill Skarsg√•rd, Ian McShane, Clancy Brown, Laurence Fishburne, and Shamier Anderson among others. Major disappointments are Keanu Reeve's worst ever line readings, and the wimpy melee fight scenes: punch, kick, chop, stab, pointblank CGI headshot, repeat. But such fare saw JOHN WICK 3 earn $328 million from a budget of $75 million, so loyal fans should enjoy it. I reckon it's good for one viewing because of the ending. There's also a scene in the credits. 6/10 Weet-Bix.",6

moritzherz,"John Wick is the best action movie franchise of all time. This is NOT debatable.

Over the last years we got 4 movies and every single one of them was extraordinary. Action of a quality never seen before and always great stories around that. Powerful actors like Lance Reddick, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, Bill Skarsgard and of course THE action hero KEANU REEVES.

It may not be the longest action movie franchise (James Bond) or the most succesful (MCU) but it has the best action and therefore has to be the best ACTION franchise. The creativity and realism this action consists of is astonishing. The cinematography is always dark, but beautiful. Chapter 4 is in that case the best.

But what makes this franchise unforgettable is its ending. First of all we got an ending, many action movie franchises did not find an acceptable ending or they are searching for it until today. But that is not the case for John Wick, because they concluded his story masterfully with this last entry. The whole movie is one last ride and therefore builds up tension so we get a huge payoff in the end.

John Wick not only dominated the box office and completely destroyed Marvel's woke disaster called Ant-Man, it showed Hollywood how to make an entertaining and successfull blockbuster movie. Something we rarely get to see these days.

With this said, John Wick Chapter 4 is definitely worth watching, Action fans have to see it and fans of blockbuster movies as well.

And that all because someone killed his dog!",8

mechmandeep,"My expectations were high specially around the fight sequence but it was disappointing. Last three chapters had some special sachets l set ups and sequences, the stable fight scene and the knife fight in the antique store. That was the genius of the movie, even though you expect it to be a kill fest there was creativity around that preventing it from being repetitive.

Chapter 4 is just that, pretty much the overdose of the boring sequences from the first 3 chapters.

The other aspect around how much hits and badgering can John take is also puts this in superhero genre. I mean, he is not captain america for crying out loud.

The storyline holds well though there are crucial pieces missing. How did he find the elder and was it just to get back the ring? With almost 3 hours duration you expect to cover that. There are lose ends with a daughter's revenge for her father and John wick letting his friend die in vein.

I feel they could've cut one fight scene to cover these points and competed the movie. This series had done so well to bring continuity all this time just to drop the ball at the end!",6
chrisjw-01026,"Despite not watching the previous John Wick movies, this was still amazing. I would say that it didn't have to be that long and there definitely could have been some small cuts at least.

John Wick is all about the action and I like how they don't try to bs things too much like other action movies. The action scenes were one of a kind. Long and intense choreography over intesely fun music, mixed with the challenge of weapon/ride swapping, and even topped off with creative cinematography. The top down scene is the pinnacle of that. It was both intense and fun and something i've never seen before in an action movie. I couldnt help to smile at how mind blown I was for watching it.",9
palashpatel-24828,"This movie has set a really high bar for movies, honestly the best movie and hope it wins oscar. If you are going to see this movie your attention will fully in the movie and won't be distracted at all, the action scenes are the best and Suprisingly there is more comedy than i expected and the dialogues form each character is great. There are obviously some problems with few parts of the movie but it doesn't affect much to the movie, problems such as few scenes where it was looking obvious it was cgi but the cinematography made up for it ,and Secondly it felt like Wicks pistol had unlimited bullets and it did make it feel a little unrealistic and lastly the end credit disappointed a little bit,we expected the end credit would be something unexpected and mind-blowing but it did kinda disappoint.

But overall with these problems it still didn't matter as the movie was on another level its the best chapter out of 1 2 3 and it was worth the wait of 4 years . And might be one of the best action movie. This movie was loved by the audience in the theatre they enjoyed every part of the movie the reaction were great The hype about this movie was worth it and you would want to watch it multiple times.",10
johnnyhbtvs27,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is another great entry in this wonderful series. The franchise has got it's bond beats down in the form of:

1. Meets up with Laurence Fishburne and receives new artillery.

2. The Hit Squad is called and the DJ plays records and narrates the action.

3. John Wick goes through 'mini bosses' to reach the 'big boss'.

4. Insane set pieces which can last for up to 20 minutes.

5. Dog.

This series could last another 10 movies and i would be front and centre every time. John Wick has joined the elite of film franchises which only contain great movies and no duds. Here's to many more.",9
adamdcohen-60392,"I can't help but wonder what it means about our society when a movie with a plot that seems written by an 8 year old, awful dialogue, and action scenes that are laughably impractical are overlooked because there are attractive people dressed well in pretty places.

This movie seems to go out of its way to be implausible. Scenes like extended violence while unsuspecting club dancers seem totally unbothered left me rolling my eyes and confused about what others are seeing when they rate this movie so highly.

I sure hope this isn't part of a trend in movie writing and that movies with at least basic plausibility are still appreciated.",4
sami2005,"I felt so much bored after the first 90 min.

Unnecessary long, some seens are beyond logic.

Good that this is the last chapter. I wasted almost three hours and I regret that. I thought after 40 min of watching whether this is a new Marvel character!!

I could not understand the critic's review or some viewers reviews whom gave a rating above 3 on what basis they gave a such rating.

I liked John Wick Part 1, it was a new kind if action, Part 2 was an entertaining story, Part 3 started to feel bored and should end the series in this Part.

I hope to see Keanu Reeves with a better movies as I like him.",3
jostenson-74432,"Having watched all of the John Wick movies, I can safely say this is the worst.

John Wick has gone from a grieving man avenging the death of his dog and taking out a few gangsters to a superhuman who can dodge bullets, survive multiple bone breaking building falls and repeated falling down stairs.

After action scene number whatever, it all ends up being extremely samey. Where's the risk, the danger? He can apparently survive anything and everything thrown at him.

And don't get me started on the bullet dodging blind man! It takes ridiculousness to a whole new level. The intelligent first movie has all but been diluted to this mess.",4
gcsman,"My (adult) daughter, who's the kindest, gentlest person you can imagine, really likes the John Wick movies and this one in particular. I'm always a little surprised at that, but it's hard not to be impressed with the incredibly well choreographed violence they are all built on, and by now with Chapter 4 that's the whole point. JW4 has not one but three outstanding set pieces to its credit: the gunfight inside a building, seen from above as if we're looking down on a dollhouse (my favorite); the combat-in-traffic at the Arc de Triomphe; and then the long fight up (and down) that staircase below Sacre Coeur. All of them go on past any semblance of realism, but again, that's the point.

These movies exist far into a fantasy world of their own making. In this one I felt that it was starting to move into Tarantino-like territory: various scenes start out with long stretches of simple, almost banal dialog and only then erupt into complicated combat. Keanu Reaves as the title hero never did get much of a script to work with in the previous rounds, but here his lines have been pared down to almost nothing. However, he can get more out of a simple 'yeah' than any other actor I can think of.

At almost 3 hours run time there's enough material here for almost two movies, and that's the main problem I had with it. It just got exhausting. I was ready for things to wind up by (say) the two-hour mark. And is the ending really the end? The thing about John Wick (unlike the James Bond films) is you can't really imagine anyone else but Keanu doing the role.",7
hristokasabov,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is one of the most exciting,hyperkinetic and beautiful action movies ever made. Director Chad Stahelski has make a name because of this franchase. Chad has crazy,modern ideas. We see how Keanu was saying about 300 words but on the right spot. Baba Yaga is fighting versus High Table and we see Marquis who is Bill Skarsgard. Wow!!! He actually was the right actor for this role. I was shocked by Akira she deserved series or movie. Winston again with crucial role in this movie. This movie is D category or 16+ and this have a lot of blood and fights. This movie is perfect deserve to watch!!!",10
Vivekmaru45,"I have to see the first one again after a lapse of many, many years.

For those who haven't seen other similar modern ones, these two: Death Sentence(2007) and I Am Wrath(2016) also worth your time.

This movie sets out to be the final installment in the franchise that sees the events following the first three films of the series. The movie is about an old retired assassin who has fallen from grace with everyone out to get him. This latest entry hopes to put an end to his years of conflict with the High Table a secret organization that has put an ever-growing bounty on his head.

As with previous John Wick films, there is a main antagonist that Wick must get rid off. There are lot of side characters in this one, that draws away the attention from Wick. Indeed Wick is not the focus of attention of this film. Bill Istvan G√ºnther Skarsg√•rd who plays Marquis Vincent de Gramont, the antagonist, a suave and aristocratic sadist and head of the High Table, along with Donnie Yen who plays Caine(biblical reference) a blind assassin of the High table. These two steal the show along with short cameos from my favorite actor Laurence Fishburne(Just Cause 1995 and Hannibal 2013-2015 TV Series).

Verdict: the action sequences are standard with today's action-thriller genre. Nothing outstanding to speak off. The reason being over-saturation of movies in the internet and the film industry as a whole worldwide.

There will come a time people will stop watching movies altogether. The same is true with the PC/Console gaming industry. As soon as you figure out both are ""scripted"" you'll see the ""light"". All I recommend as wholesome entertainment for the family are 70's-80's comedy shows like The Jeffersons, Good Times, Sanford and Son, The Cosby Show, Silver Spoons, Different Strokes, Webster and many more...

Stay safe and thank you for taking the time to read this review.",4
morpheusfilms,"More of a comedy than a decent action film. Jumped the shark with a blind assassin! Omg seriously? Good cinematography is all JW4 has going for it.

This film needed a complete rewrite.

Waste of time, go see something else; anything else than this rubbish.

Exception: if you are into filmmaking and/or screenwriting see it to understand why all those rules exist because this film breaks them all and the painful result is glaringly obvious. Bring strong coffee.

Personally I would've taken the conclusion in a different direction with Wick walking away and disappearing to some remote location to put an end to the conflict with The Table (and the bloodshed), but instead winds up finding another war to fight, this time for a reason we care about.

He wins but the conflict alerts The Table AND thats why he needs to re-enter the game; ie to put an end, not to the Marquise but to The Table itself. Thereby setting not only himself free in martyrdom but everyone else as well.

In this film JW gets a bunch of people killed for his own selfish reasons and we are supposed to care about his plight? And what does he achieve in the end? Nothing; except peace in his own death (and a few less scumbags on the planet i guess). He could've found freedom from The Table with a single bullet and saved all those other people.

I simply don't understand this level of narcissism, perhaps I'm just too caring?

The problems with this film are too numerous to mention. I will say however that shooting across traffic as innocent people pass by is considered to be an acceptable thing to do for ""the hero"". Wow really?

The high praise for this film has me very concerned about where society is headed, both intellectually and morally.",1
nogodnomasters,"Laurence Fishburne introduces the film by letting us know this is a continuation of the ""Dante's Inferno"" theme. Wick (Keanu Reeves) has determined he must kill all the heads of""The Table."" After killing one, he no longer has to come after them, they are coming after him and anyone who might help him. Like the Hydra that goes a new heads every time one is cut off, the table gets a replacement every time one is killed. Wick's old friend Caine (Donnie Yen) a blind man who makes Rutger Hauer (Blind Fury) look like a sissy. There is also a bounty hunter after Wick named Tracker or No One (Shamier Anderson) who has a strange relationship with Wick who he wants to keep alive for the time being until the bounty get higher. Things become foreboding when Charon (Lance Reddick) the boatman to Hades is killed in an early scene trapping Wick in Hades forever killing, like Sisyphus forever rolling his rock up a hill. Another planned is devised where Wick challenges the Marquis (Bill Skarsg√•rd) to a one on one dual, i.e in order to get out rather than play a chess match with death (Seventh Seal, Bergman) he fights a dual.

The film starts out rather slow with just three men dying in the first four minutes. There is an Asian scene that gave me ""Kill Bill"" flashbacks. The soundtrack was great. You would have thought someone would have given John an apology and a puppy.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",10
lunarpeople,"Another installation and it seems the main focus of the film is on the beauty of the light shining on the endless well(almost)-choreographed fight scenes. The very intricacy of the crime world falls short behind quickly spitted out ""old"" rules and traditions. It's easy to get lost in all these ""but if you are a part of some family (or 2 families!), you can do it"". Arguebly simply a barrage of info that stops making sense at some point. I gave up on following this maze of criminal dos and donts and ended up simply ""enjoying"" KR fallen of the 3d floor onto a side of the car and walking away, rolling down an endless fight of stairs and managing to walk back up... almost 2 times :) The movie becomes ridiculous pretty quickly and honestly is saved only by endless ridiculous action scenes, which are pretty much what this movie is all about... Done! John Weak...",5
tommy-97761,"Sadly (for me) this is the first John Wick movie I've seen in the cinema. Had I gone to every each part, I might have understood the hype concerning the sequels sooner. This is surely an unpopular opinion, but the first movie allways felt pretty complete and satisfying as it was, with a clear goal, villain, action and worldbuilding. Though the sequels are full of awesome setpieces, modern action and more worldbuilding, it allways felt overly complicated. Well the fourth one made me understand. I still like the first movie the most, the experience of seeing this in the cinema just left me in glee for the entire runtime. I recognised action actors, stuntmen. The cinematography even during slow conversations is beautiful. The lighting, sets, music so stylistic. The action performed in choreographed long takes. Sometimes ridiculously long takes. The whole John Wick series is a loveletter to all stuntmen and action fans. An action movie done right, and the small screen does not do this series justice. You need to see those setpieces on a big screen and hear each bullet trough a propper sound system. Real locations, practical stunts, precise camera work, what more could you ask for? Of you still have a chamce to see this on the big screen, go and do it.",8
NeoPavlik,"I've enjoyed each John Wick movie more than the last. 4 > 3 > 2 > 1.

The ""Neon Noir"" style is so pretty and they continually bring artistry to the violence that keeps it fresh. I wish I could be an extra during the underground party scenes because they look so cool.

Despite a long run time I didn't feel it as the pacing and build was very good. Stakes , pacing, timing , consequences !

The art and back rounds lend life to the seedy underworld.

There was quite a few more new characters introduced in this one and they do a very good job of fleshing them out and making you care about them or giving them their own style.",10
vivekmadireddy,"I have never written a movie review ever but I am compelled to write this one. This is most idiotic, nonsensical movie ever made. What do you get out of 180 minutes of killing people? Nothing.

I understand John Wick itself is a genre but pushing a genre to it's extreme with total lack of sanity is nothing but treating the audience as fools. And thinking that your audience will watching anything that calls itself John Wick and has Keanu playing the role is disrespecting your own audience.

I loved the first John Wick. It has human emotion in it. But this Chapter 4 is nothing but a video game. What a mess!! Total nonsense.

Keanu. Wrong choice man.

SMH.",1
squigemartin,"John wick chapter 4 is the best of the John wick series, and that was very hard to do after the first three. From start to finish it is a pure adrenaline rush.

The acting is top notch - Keanu reeves it top quality as always - Winston and the Bowery king are acted amazingly - but the two new character who stole the show were Donnie Yen as Caine and Mr Nobody - really awesome characters - hope to see more of them in the future.

For me - this is the best action film of all time.

The choreography - the set pieces - the insanely violent action and the camera work is all done to perfection. Genuinely brilliant from start to finish. Chad Stahelski is also top quality and has defiantly come to his own as a director.

I cannot recommend this movie enough - I cannot find a flaw in the 2h 49m run time (which only feels like 2h). Do yourself a favour and see it in cinema.

11/10 üëç",10
rich-mac,"There really is very little story time - maybe 20 minutes of the runtime - but probably not that much. The rest is just basically the same kind of fight scene, repeated over and over in different locations. The locations are mostly great - the monotonous action wears very thin quite early on.

I seem to remember that some of the earlier Wick movies had proper story lines - somewhere along the line they ditched them for non-stop repetitive action - action that stretches credulity well past breaking point - but some of it, especially towards the end, was ridiculous nonsense.

For any serious movie buff this installment completely fails to make the grade and is a total waste of time. Worse, it sullies the franchise.

2 stars for the locations, and because it's professionally made technically.

Minus 8 points for the lack of an engaging story and for reaching a new high for banal gratuitous violence.

Summary: So bad it's almost funny. But it's not funny, it's vacuous nonsense that cost a fortune to produce.",2
saikatsamanta,"In 2014, Chad Stahelski & Keanu Reeves brought John Wick to theaters and turned the Action Genre on its head. An emotionally poignant tale with stylized action like never before, inside a riveting world of assassins. In the sequels the action got amped and the world became more fascinating. And in this penultimate chapter of the franchise, the level of Action has reached a level that can only be described as ""Insanity"". Too many times I was grabbing my head in sheer disbelief as to how they came up with the unbelievable stuff that was happening. The set pieces can easily be included in the Greatest Action Scenes of all time. The Cinematography, background score, dialogues hit perfectly. Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Sanada, Bill Skarsgard are perfect in their roles. And to top it off, a beautiful ending that completes this legendary franchise.

Dont Miss This one..",9
Arcadia1701,"This movie has it all and then some. At no stage does it ever pretend to be anything more than it is or was always going to be. In fact, it doubles down on its preposterousness and unashamedly pushes out a high fueled octane nonsense film of staggeringly little story.

The first hour has almost no storyline at all - why bother at this point - just extremely well crafted fight scene after fight scene. Scenes of huge ornate mansions/buildings with hundreds of faceless henchmen to slaughter. Righteous revenge. Blind ninja assassins. Kevlar dinner suits. Fast and the furious level corny. Keanu has about 10 lines the whole movie - but that's a benefit trust me.

Do you need to have seen the other 3? Maybe but not essential. Number 5 is a certainty at this point - look for the spin off as well. If you want to check your brain with a franchise this is the movie for you.",7
paul_w-18042,"To many poor decisions. John Wick the indestructible man versus daredevil.... No sense of peril, no consequences.... Everyone has bullet proof suits, but not one of the countless disposable useless henchmen thinks to maybe aim for the head?? I get it's a movie and get John Wick is a man of focus..... But walks away from getting hit by so many cars I lost count, literally falling out of buildings... But then dies from a mere stomach wound....... Loved the first two, was just about ok with the third, but this one was too far for me to stretch I am afraid. Just cant understand all the rave reviews...",2
TharsheyN,"John Wick Chapter 4 carries on the story from where it left off in chapter 3, John is still on the run but now he needs to try get the High Table off his back. How he does that or attempts to anyway forms the crux of Chapter 4's storyline.

The solid story combined with outstanding acting from Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Sanada, Bill Skarsg√•rd, Ian McShane and Lance Riddick leaves you with a gripping story that will have you absorbed in it throughout it's 169 minute runtime.

Combined with excellent action sequences, gunplay, crazy shootouts and fight scenes John Wick Ch 4 is a top notch action film that stands with it's head held high from the mess that Hollywood is nowadays. Especially love the scene where John is clearing the building room by room and the camera is viewing it top down like one of those mobile shooter games.

I loved the movie, It's fun and enjoyable and it definitely deserves the 8 stars I've rated it. The place where the movie looses 2 stars is because John dies at the end and I can't bear to see him not have a happy ending after 4 movies of revenge and death and hatred and anger. So 8/10 from me because of that.",8
philipstrong-07489,"I entered the cinema with great expectations I left with PTSD ... far too much shooting, violence and good old 'death', what happened to substance. I'm sure I actually saw John Wick shake at one point as if Mr Keanu Reeves was reacting to the constant chronic violence.

The cinematography and music are strikingly very good at the beginning of the movie alas they fade to the norm as the movie continues. There is a great overhead scene, yes very violent set inside a building which I watch again.

Ian McShane has a peach of a part where as Donnie Yen,Bill Skarsgard fill the movie with atmosphere.

Sadly I wanted to give it a 10 but my ears are still ringing!",7
chajaso,"It felt as if I was watching John Wick fight the same person for 2hrs... It got to the point where I found myself wanting for the fighting to end because it felt repetitive.

The bad guy was one of those ""I'll sit around and so nothing but look sophisticated and rich until I get killed"" typed of bad guys.

The blind guy had super hearing while fighting everyone else in the movie except when it came to fighting John; then he was just a regular blind guy who couldn't hear if someone was death or alive.

The ""nobody"" character could've been out of the movie and nothing in the movie would've changed.",2
saidbelwahed,"John wick 4 is just John wick 3 that is the same as John wick 2, The same movie again and again, nothing will change if you cut the movies all in half and watched them randomly, it's exact same thing.

And so I'm tired of the endless stamina of the protagonist, and not having even one injury after falling from a building or hit by a car o falling 222 stairs, I wish this was a super hero movie i would have enjoyed it more.

Don't get me wrong I'm okay with the theatrical scenes and overall direction of the movie.

And I don't understand how some people are saying this movie have put a new standard for action, it's literally a series of nonsense scenes, it would be real bad if the industry adopted this kind of nonsense...",4
ysoserious-20248,"Like many John Wick fans I considered the original film to be an amazing sleeper hit with an original premise that reignited Keanu Reeves' star power, and John Wick: Chapter 2 was a bombastic sequel that took us deeper into the world of Wick's former livelihood.

John Wick: Chapter 3 made me grow numb and impatient sitting in my chair. It was like watching someone play a Beat Em' Up (or Shoot Em' Up) game where they go through waves of enemies until they get to the level boss. Streets of Rage and Time Crisis come to mind. Anyone who is a gamer and a film buff knows what I'm talking about. In John Wick: Chapter 4 it felt like more of the same.

A recurring theme since the third film is that John Wick is given literal plot armor in the form of a Kevlar suit, but also the waves of bullet sponge henchmen he can effectively dispatch with a headshot. JUST. LIKE. A. VIDEOGAME. He can also survive getting thrown off a roof AND fall down five flights of steps. Might as well give Wick a life bar floating over his head.

Then there are the dogs with a pencant for biting men's testes and the stock cartoon European Villain of the Week who uses underhanded methods to kill Wick. Russian, Italian, German, French, whatever. They're all interchangeable.

Ditto for the largely Asian ""top assassins"" that will pop up to give Keanu Reeves the best choreographed fight scene. And let's not forget the EDM clubs and metro city subways where civilians are largely oblivious to what's going on.

All of this stuff is trite and cliche, and I guess this is what people like because it's a break from the superhero fare that has saturated the action movie genre for the past 15 to 25 years.

Maybe it's because I grew up in a decade (1990's) where there were still good high-profile films being produced in a sea of higher-profile schlock that my film tastes are hungry for something engaging and thought-provoking, and John Wick 4 ain't it no matter how much people try to pretend that the world these characters live in is compelling.",6
cinephile-007,"John wick chapter 4 has everything an action flick has to offer. The movie runs almost 3hrs and you wouldn't be able to take your eyes off for even a minute.

Bill skarsgard was a nice addition to an already perfect casting. Especially Donnie yen stood out of all the others. Also Shamier as Mr. Nobody was fun to watch.

As for the fight sequences, Keanu Reeves has given his everything to it and it reflects well in the film.

Another standout thing is the cinematography of the movie. It has some brilliant shots especially the final duel has amazing cinematography.

Overall John wick chapter 4 is undoubtedly one of the best action movies ever made and will be an absolute treat for the fans.",8
Saoustou88,"This film is unmatched, unparalleled and out-skills any action film ever made in the history of cinema...it is in a category of its own. Keanu Reeves is a martial arts badass menace. John Wick Chapter 4 needs no introduction and there are literally NO WORDS to describe the masterpiece that I have just witnessed in the cinema. Which is the only way to see this and do it justice. Part 1 was insane and Chapter 2 was crazy amazing, but I actually skipped Chapter 3 as Halle was very boring in the first hour. However I knew with Bill Skarsgaard as the villain, the Swedish actor known for IT, that this should not be missed as dude can act. Well Lo and behold nothing prepared me for the fight scenes, the BODY COUNT, the 99 lives of John. Donnie Yen is amazing end of story. Keanu is everything. And the cinematography and the locations in Europe are breath-taking...like I watched the most beautiful dream. Lord Jesus Christ the Berlin club scene. The fight sequence on Paris's Arc de Triomphe, speechless. Let's just say that Chad Stahleski gave us violence with a capital V in its most artistic form. He's the Michaelangelo of cinema. Deepness, love, fear and fatigue. Remember the insane fight scene on motorbikes in 2017's The Villainess, a messy Korean revenge masterpiece? Well ALL of John Wicks fight scenes are this but on steroids. Respect and Rest in Peace Lance Reddick.",10
DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,"Ok, You Gotta End This Franchise now, After the Action Scenes in this, there's no possible way to Top the Action Scenes after John Wick 4. The Outlandish And Super Cool Characters, that Ending üëå. This was it.

Things I liked about John Wick 4 -

1. The Cinematography, Lighting and Costume Design were Beautiful to Look At.

2. The Dragons Breath Birds Eye View Scene was Very Good.

3. The Circular Gun Drive-By Car Scene was Astonishing to Watch and was Such a Good Scene.

4. The Circular Fights with Cars Driving By was Also a Good Part of That Scene.

5. The Blind Guy, at times, has Some insane Hand Speed with that Sword and Fists.

6. The Staircase Scene was Ridiculous but it was Shot Beautifully and Again, it Was Fun.

7. I really liked the Gold Teeth Purple Suit Guy and the Poker Game they Had.

8. The Main Boss Was Solid.

9. The Right Hand Man was on another Level. Such a Badass and Super Cool.

10. The Russian Woman was Dripping with Coolness, The Raven Slick Back Hair, The Neck Movements and Mannerisms, the Beautiful Jewellery, She was Super Cool

11. The Club Fight Scene was Ridiculous but it Looked Good. Again this Movie Felt like a Show.

12. I didn't Know how they would end the Third Act. The way The Ending Duel Panned Out, and the Laugh from ""Mr Nobody"" was a Nice Touch. üëå

13. Some of the Fist Fights and Combat Fights were Good. Some Great Hand Speed üëç

14. The Sound Design in the Combat was Really Good.

Overall, John Wick 4 is a Moments Based Symphony, Sort of like a Show, it has Some Good Combat, Good Action, and at Times Amazing Action and a Couple of Astonishing Moments, Specifically the Circle Drive-By Gun Scene from Wick.",10
Prismark10,"This is the longest John Wick movie, it's probably also the best and the one with the bigger budget.

In Chapter 4 the Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsg√•rd) is out to get anyone helping John Wick (Keanu Reeves.) Bad news for Winston Scott (Ian McShane) as his Continental hotel in New York is destroyed.

In Japan, a blind assassin Caine (Donnie Yen) is sent by the Marquis to deal with Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada) who is shielding Wick at the Osaka Continental.

Wick has no option but to take the fight to the Marquis. A duel in Paris for his freedom and for Winston to get his new Continental.

There are breathtaking action scenes, maybe even to make John Woo envious. Some of it is inspired by video games shoot em ups.

Chapter 4 borrows from many other movies. The opening is a homage to Lawrence of Arabia and could had been cut. Fishburne's meeting with Wick is pure Q from the Bond films. Some of the action scenes are Kill Bill. The gangs chasing Wick for the increased bounty broadcast on radio. That was straight out of The Warriors.

If there was one big criticism. Surely someone could had told John Wick. The fastest way to get to the Sacre Coeur is not to be dropped off in front of the Eiffel Tower!",7
paul_haakonsen,"Well, of course I had to sit down and watch the 2023 movie ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" from director Chad Stahelski, as I have thoroughly enjoyed the previous three movies.

Writers Shay Hatten, Michael Finch and Derek Kolstad put together a good enough storyline. Well, with this being a ""John Wick"" movie, then of course you know that the narrative is not really the driving force here, it is the abundance of action. The storyline is fairly okay, take it for what it is, and just enjoy the action.

And an abundance of action there was to be seen in ""John Wick: Chapter 4"", that was for certain. Maybe even a bit too much actually, because running at 169 minutes, it was a long, long movie. And it was getting a bit tedious towards the last 30 minutes or so to sit through. I mean, even while the action sequences are nicely choreographed and feels like a nicely orchestrated dance sequence, then it got repetitive to watch John Wick waltz almost unscathed through hordes of gunmen and putting one bullet in the head of one after another. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely good entertainment, and I was genuinely entertained, but the movie was long.

""John Wick: Chapter 4"" has a good cast ensemble. Of course it is nice to see Keanu Reeves return to the role of John Wick, and he was joined by other returning actors such as Laurence Fishburne, Lance Reddick and Ian McShane. The movie also have some nice performances and appearances by the likes of Clancy Brown, Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsg√•rd, Shamier Anderson and Hiroyuki Sanada. Now, Bill Skarsg√•rd was an interesting choice for the main villain in ""John Wick: Chapter 4"", and he did a good job, though his attempt of a French-English accent was a bit all over the place.

Visually then ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is quite good, as it has been throughout all of the previous movies as well. I was especially pleased with the sequence that took place inside an old building where you see the action from a bird's view, top-down. That was such a blast of a sequence.

This is an action movie, first and foremost. And you are in for a treat of action, because ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is nearly 169 minutes of non-stop action. Don't think realism into the picture when you sit down to watch this movie, because realism is way out the window. Just lean back, have your snacks ready and enjoy the non-stop action roller coaster.

I was genuinely entertained by the movie, I will say that, though the movie could have benefitted a bit from a more extensive trim in the editing room.

All in all, a good fourth movie in a very enjoyable franchise all together. My rating of ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" lands on a seven out of ten stars. The movie is worth an eight star rating, but the long playtime sort of felt like an anchor around the overall enjoyment of the movie, and thus drags it down to a seven star rating for me.",7
kristof-van-den-bosch,"First one was good, 2nd was better and really good. Third was the best, so I thought, it's going the right direction.. I couldn't be more wrong.. First of all, what made the previous movies so great and especially the third one, was the details in the action scenes were so accurate.. All of the sudden in the beginning of the hotel in Japan, John wick kept shooting without reload, until he was alone there doing the shooting..? At the end as well.. 21 bullets in his gun. It seemed more.. Also again in so many movies lately, why exag√©rating so much and making scenes so long, especially during some dialogues.. You know what they're gonna say or what's coming.. And when he fell down the stairs at the end. That was so over the top and unnecessary and so unrealistic.. He had 8 minutes to climb those 222 steps or so, whilst kicking everybody's ass. 3 minutes to go and down he goes all the way to the bottom and start over, crawl back up, little dialogue with Donnie y'en and make it both in time..?? The director said he had to make movie this long to tell the story. That's not true at all. Story wise, it had no positive effect. He just put in more and longer action scenes.. Total let down when you compare it the previous movies. And very predictable also at some times.. This movie wasnt worth waiting so long and definetly not my money..",1
jacksongaming-80094,"John Wick Chapter 4 is a love letter to action film-making and every action cinema lovers wet dream. The cinematography is oscar worthy, the neo-noir genre has never looked better on the big screen as the bold and vibrant colours makes each scene of this film a bold underlined statement that what you are experiencing is something special.

The action choreography utilizies 100% of each and every set design used in the film to incorporate drama, thrill and also comedy. This movie has everything you could ever ask for - guns, knifes, nunchucks, katanas, martial arts, cars, flamethrowers, bare hands etc. The stuntwork is jaw-dropping and adrenaline inducing, specially a stunt that was performed on a staircase on the later half of the film, left me wondering how did the stunt coordinator get that Tom Cruise-level life threatening stunt greenlit.

But what truly makes this story special are the characters and the drama surrounding them as they manoeuvre their way through this twisted world of crime where each person is their only friend. There are a lot of new characters introduced and none of them feel throwaway as each and everyone of them bring something new and exciting to the table and moves the narrative forward. And the centre of this narrative, Keanu Reeves who plays John Wick, a loving husband proves once again why his contribution to this role will be remembered forever as something that revolutionalized action film-making.

This was the one of the most satisfying experience I ever had inside a movie theatre and it leaves you with the question that how many times are you going to return to experience this once in a lifetime masterclass in action film-making.

10/10 - John wick Chapter 4 is a a modern day classic.",10
carloscampo-52232,"Probably the benchmark modern action movie that every other would aspire to look up to from now on. From the cinematography to the soundtrack, this is truly on another level. The story is gripping and the ending is really satisfactory.

It is remarkable how tight the dialogue is. Like really tight, no unnecessary word is spoken by our main character. And yet the movie is clear to follow through, with the motivations, emotional toll and stakes of each character being clear to the audience.

Surely no movie is perfect and there are details that could be better for the perfectionist, but this is action to the next level. Exiting for the future of action movies that might try to match or improve on this one.

This movie is truly a must see!",10
bn229,"The ending of 'John Wick: Parabellum' (a.k.a. Chapter 3) promised a few important things. And it is pretty clear that the makers of Chapter 4 have not delivered on those promises.

First, we saw no real plan from John Wick or Winston or The Bowery King (Lawrence Fishburn) to take on The High Table or The Elder. A couple characters (Winston being one of them) actually point this out, and John Wick's only answer is, ""I'm going to kill them."" But that doesn't solve his problem: the High Table isn't just going to stop.

Second, i was IMMENSELY disappointed that Lawrence Fishburn did not have a more central role in this chapter. The ending of Chapter 3 suggested that this vendetta and war against the High Table was as much his as it was John Wick's. It would certainly have made for a far more interesting plot to have the Bowery King's forces join with his royal counterpart in Paris or Berlin or Osaka or wherever in order to fight The High Table.

And lastly, the fight scenes were quite ... well, boring. Just the same shoot-shoot-shoot, thrust, stab, flip enemy over shoulder, shoot or stab until dead. Then repeat ad nauseum.

Also, John Wick is not a superhero with mutant superpowers. When he falls 30 feet and lands hard on his midsection, he should be hurt. Badly. Or even be dead. His ability to keep getting up and never get get hit by a bullet just seemed contrived and sloppy.

I had hoped for a bigger and cleverer send-off for this story.",5
marwinsingh-30063,"There is no denying that John wick series will become an classical masterpiece in future.. If you've seen previous 3 films you then you should know what to expect.. Keanu Reeves is back again legendery hitman aka Baba Yaga who'll stop at nothing to earn his freedom and defeat high table and seeing him doing that will give you an unforgettable cinematic experience.. For 3 hrs I was lost in this epic world that director Chad Stahlski has created for this story, Keanu Reeves is already an action icon, rest of cast has also done a perfect job.. Action choreographer and stunt team deserves an Oscar for their effort which lead us to some of the best fight scenes and action sequences ever played on big screen.. Cinematography is also very beautiful, dark and neon filled visulas just enhance the experience of story there is also some drama and emotional moments in this story but main aspect of this film is out of the world action.. There is a unique over the head camera action scene which is best part of this movie, Donnie yen is also great here proving again that he is one of the best action stars of Asian cinema, Scott Adkins is also done a surprisingly great scene which I was not expecting because he usually play hardcore fighter in his movies here he is hilarious and his look is different.. From start to finish JW 4 is an action ride which gets better and better each passing minute, 3rd act will keep you edge of your seat, last 45 to 50 minutes were some of the best action sequences I've ever seen in my life and I've seen thousands of films from every genere from all over the world cinema industries so i know a good action scene when I see it and believe me this was something I've seen first time in my life.... Overall don't miss this film if you're fan of action movies and if you're an Baba Yaga fan like me then just go for it to experience it on big screen with Dolby atmos sound you'll spend a quality time....

AN MODERN ACTION MASTERPIECE.. 10/10 ..",10
Steve9920,"Thats the way i am watching this movie..like I eat a box of maltesers. I love maltesers, but its a case of diminishing returns. First few are mmmmm! Then gradually they are just a sickly mush in your mouth. So stop!! Come back to them and enjoy the next few, repeat until finished.

Thats how this movie should be experienced. After 50 mins I just got tired of the repetitive fight scenes, came back next day and watched afresh the next 40 mins, repeat until finished.

Visuals are great, nicely set scenes are interesting and colourfully rich in red, greens, blues, shadows and neons. Throbbing score is effective and well suited to the visuals, very satisfying.

Plot is, well? Its John Wick. Dialogue is sparse and mostly without satisfactory meaning, apart from a couple of almost Philosophical utterings. Too many characters, some effective, some bland to stupid.

Watch it, but remember to brush your teeth afterwards.",5
steverice-12942,"ALL reality must be suspended for this totally unbelievable film. Can't believe I wasted and of my precious time on this trash. The fight scenes were well choreographed, however that's all the film is, just one fight after another with Reeves surviving clearly unsurvivable situations, to the point where the audience was just laughing. If it is meant to be a comedy, then it isn't that funny, it this is not a film that you can take seriously either!!

Won't be watching any more Wicks films, that's for sure. Highly disappointing trip to the cinema, which in any event is rare these days, as so many films are below par.",1
annapoulantzas,"Well, yes, Keanu might be the nicest guy in Hollywood, but this movie is just a shallow, sometimes darkly humoresque, cartoonish, modern fable that fits well with equally shallow times... It is entertaining, though. In this age of boring democratic and relatively peaceful life people are thirsty for violence, revenge and gore, so our natural and primitive animal instincts can get satisfied. This chapter is probably the weakest, by the way. It feels extremely repetitive. I had to rewatch the trailer to make sure I was not going to pay for the same movie I had already watched. Hopefully it will be the last of the franchise, unless they find a way to come up with a radical new idea that can save it.",4
fisher-31087,"Overall, I enjoyed what the film had to offer, if you're looking for a few hours where your brain is turned off this is ideal. That being said this is easily the weakest of the saga, the plot is now complete and utter nonsense, disbelieved suspended or not. The new characters that are brought in really don't have any memorable qualities and sorry to say the action scenes (whilst still excellent) don't have the same fluidity or feeling of weight as the first 3, Keanu puts an admirable show on but I think it's safe to say his age is now catching up with him.

All in all it's a hard film to critique, if you like John Wick let's face it you're going to watch it and you won't be disappointed by what you find, you just need to turn of any ounce of common sense you have whilst you watch John single handily murder half of France.",6
MAD_PIGE0N,"John Wick: Chapter 4, while delivering on its signature high-octane action sequences, ultimately falls short of its potential. The film's mediocrity stems from several key factors that hinder its ability to stand out in the crowded landscape of action cinema.

One of the main drawbacks of the movie is the titular character himself. John Wick, played by Keanu Reeves, is undeniably an iconic figure in modern action films. However, in this installment, his persona becomes excessively overexaggerated. Gone are the nuances and complexities that made Wick intriguing in the earlier films. Instead, we are presented with a one-dimensional killing machine devoid of any genuine character development.

Moreover, the inclusion of the blind Japanese adds to the film's downfall. Unfortunately, this character serves as nothing more than a caricature, relying on outdated stereotypes that have long plagued Hollywood. It is disheartening to witness such regressive choices in a supposedly progressive era of filmmaking.

Furthermore, John Wick: Chapter 4 suffers from an excessive reliance on old Hollywood stereotypes and cliches. From the predictable plot twists to the recycled dialogue, the film fails to break new ground. Instead, it falls into the trap of rehashing worn-out tropes that have become all too familiar to audiences. This lack of originality hampers the overall impact of the story, leaving viewers with a sense of disappointment.

While the film does boast impressive action sequences, they cannot compensate for its inherent flaws. The choreographed fight scenes may be visually appealing, but they fail to add depth to the narrative or provide a fresh perspective on the genre. They simply serve as flashy distractions that do little to elevate the overall quality of the film.

In conclusion, John Wick: Chapter 4 falls short of expectations due to its overexaggerated protagonist, the inclusion of a poorly developed character relying on stereotypes, and an excessive reliance on tired Hollywood cliches. Despite its visually captivating action sequences, the film lacks the substance and originality necessary to make a lasting impact. Ultimately, it settles for mediocrity, leaving viewers yearning for a more innovative and thought-provoking cinematic experience.",N/A
ThironthoramDude,"Although this latest installment was a tad bit longer than the rest of these movies in the series it was every bit worth it. With the introduction of a few martial arts Legends the movie took the series to the next level.

The creative Geniuses behind some of those long single shot fight sequences deserves a hats off. A couple of them really stand out. One overhead shot of John Wick running from room to room fighting his enemies And the other with John Wick, Donny Chen and group fighting in a room filled with art pieces made of bulletproof glass.

The climax was one to behold as well.

On the whole it was a fun John Wick experience with a lot of entertaining fight sequences that makes it worth your money and time. And if you are a John Wick fan, this was what you were waiting for, and it's not going to disappoint you.",9
juraj-jerkovic,"Well thats what john wick movies are. If you find it fun to watch a lot of shooting and fighting these are your movies. I watched it with my teenage son. Went out of the theater twice during the movie to get some popcorn and a go to the toilet. Did it deliberatley during the fight scenes. Didnt feel like I missed anything. Wick rolling down the stairs reminded me of Neymar. How dumb and boring was that. Before that, he fell from a 5th floor to the street and got up without problem. Even my son found that to be too much. The New York Russians appear to be in a Catholic church. Baba Jaga they keep refering to is not the bogeyman. Its an old woman, thats what baba means. Something like a witch. But whatever. The good thing in the movie are some colorful protagonists. I cannot but think these people giving 10 stars have a vested interest to do so.",6
tigervilja,"I watched this at Imax and actually considered leaving the theater before the movie was long over. It felt ridiculous, the fighting scenes were so badly done in that Keanu was great in them,as well he was great in the movie, but ALL opponents and people around Keanu were so badly coreographed, not only once but sooo many times the opponents were just ""waiting around"" until Keanu turned around and expedited them. I know this is make-believe but some semblance to reality would have been appreciated. What bad guy in real life does not attack the hero from the back until he turns around, thats when they move. All the other Wick movies surpass this one. The action int eh first and especially the second movie were soo good. These high ratings the movie is getting is unfathomable to me.",1
FilmInPerspective,"If you're a fan of the John Wick franchise, you're in for a treat! The fourth installment of this iconic action-packed series is a wild ride that will leave you breathless from start to finish.

Without giving too much away, this movie picks up where the last one left off and takes the audience on a rollercoaster of non-stop action and heart-pumping excitement. Keanu Reeves once again delivers a stunning performance as the titular character, and the supporting cast, including newcomers to the series, really shine.

One of the things that makes this movie stand out is the incredible attention to detail in the fight scenes. The choreography is impeccable and the cinematography captures every moment in stunning detail. And let's not forget the epic soundtrack that perfectly complements the action on screen.

But it's not all about the action - this movie also has heart. There are some truly emotional moments that will tug at your heartstrings and add depth to the characters you've grown to love.

Overall, John Wick Chapter 4 is a must-see for anyone who loves action movies or just wants a thrilling ride at the cinema. Don't miss out on this adrenaline-fueled adventure!

Fun fact: This movie features more than 20 minutes of new fight choreography, making it the longest fight sequence in the franchise so far! üí™üèº",9
Dunkaccino,"If you're gonna see one action movie this year, make it John Wick Chapter 4, a non-stop action picture with the most dramatic lightning and the classiest setting. In this sequel, everyone wears expensive suits, equipped with high-tech weapons. The action sequences defy logic, physics, and human capacity.

Keanu Reeves is more a killing machine than ever, but his allies and rivals are equally dangerous: Donnie Yen chews up the scenery as a blind assassin, Scott Adkins is the longest lasting villain, an expert in martial arts. Bill Skarsgard never fought (sadly) but has a powerful presence.

My complaint towards the last John Wick movie, Parabellum, is the lack of progress in the story. This one shuts off that criticism completely. There is actual setup and payoff; Yes, all very drawn out in the near 3-hour runtime. But this is the kind of movie that I don't want to stop watching. The pacing is stunningly fast, with some truly beautiful locations (Some really stylish usage of Osaka and Paris). There is such an overload of fight scenes that the non-fight scenes underwhelms by comparison.

Watch John Wick Chapter 4 in theatres for maximum effect; you get to hear swords slash, guns fire, bullets fly, and bodies thud very clearly.",9
Mr-Fusion,"These movies have always outdone themselves, but here we are with an actual ""epic"". John Wick: Chapter 4 continuously punches above its weight with bigger and better ... well, everything. The lighting is better, the staging is more impressive, the fight choreography is absolutely insane. The excess here is the point, and it's never been more satisfying. The entire Osaka sequence feels like a marathon; then he's gun-battling in a speeding Barracuda; and there's even a setpiece built around stairs. The man even fights a guy in traffic.

TRAFFIC!

I freely admit that I'm that guy in the theater that squealed when the nunchucks came out (and they weren't a one-and-done either, he just kept beating people!)

This gave me the ""Top Gun: Maverick"" kind of high; an impeccably-paced three hours of sustained adrenaline. I don't think such enjoyment of bone-crunching violence is normal, but I don't care. This movie was an absolute blast!",9
daveforpm,"This mostly CGI movie with a now and then mumble grunt coming from Keanu Reeves is not a Crime Action Thriller, it's a Fantasy World Comedy, and is an hour too long, and so bullet repetitive it become more boring than bat ****. Is made for very simple thinking and unintelligent movie standards. Pathetic. Struggled to stay, was yarning my head off, there was nothing real about this movie. The many parents in my cinema taking their 10 year old sons to watch this movie, in a state of Australia with record skyrocketing child crime rate in the headlines the past 2yrs, shows you the type of human moronic intelligence enjoying this rubbish.",1
zakyianni-45520,"The culmination of arguably the best action franchise of all time. Keanu Reeves gives an incredible performance as John Wick as always. From the opening scene the film grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. Every fight scene (and there is a lot of them) takes place in the most gorgeous places with stunning almost otherworldly lighting. The cinematography is insanely good and a treat for the eyes. Choosing the action set pieces to take place in Osaka to Berlin to Paris gives the feeling that you as the spectator are being taken on a journey, thereby justifying the almost 3 hour run time. Donnie Yen's character; Cain and The Tracker are instant fan favourites and I'm looking forward to seeing more of them in the future. A fantastic film with a satisfying ending that leaves nothing to be desired. Well done to everyone involved. 10/10.",10
simonjtompkins,"As a massive Wick fan I was really looking forward to this....and yet left thr cinema feeling annoyed and frustrated yet again by Hollywood's obsession with making films an hour longer than they need to be.

There were some beautiful moments in the film. Some of the tight fight moves were off the chart and Reeves athleticism is incredibly impressive.

The card playing scene was pure genius. The overhead cam shot scene in the old building was revolutionary and expertly choreographed. The negotiation for the specifics of the dual was wonderful too.

The idea of a blind assassin was also fresh and the ultimate dual scene was very well handled.

However, much of the rest was so repetitive it became not only boring to watch but irritating. Watching the same gun, knife, roll, fall etc 150 times is just pointless and boring.

The penultimate scene of JW getting up the steps to the dual was painful beyond belief. I mean come on ffs!! We've watched him spend the last half hour moving a mile and kill 200 men...just get there already.

JW 1 was so fresh and new its sad that we have now ended up with an hour of amazing cinema and nearly 2 hours of what looks like a kid playing a first person shooter.

Maybe the US audience love this stuff but for the brits it would be nice if they could edit out about an hour of the repetitive and unbelievable nonsense as it had so much promise and yet fell so short.

Usual problem of studio giving production total freedom to do what they like. Money money money over finished product.",5
paul-52237,"I never go see films on release day, but I thought i'd make an exception for this film as I enjoyed the previous three so much.

This was an incredibly slow film, there was a point about 20 mins in where I thought I was really thirsty and needed a drink, so I went and bought one, came back and it was still the same scene.

The enjoyment seems to have gone, it looked like in previous episodes they thought up the craziest stunts they could - mass motorbike shoot outs, horses being chased by motorbikes and all of these things happened at a relentless pace all through the film. Now everyone's dressed in really fancy clothes, speaking in improbably bad accents and in making strange pseudo mystical comments. Do they hire cheap actors to make the budget work?

It's started to take it self way too seriously. You've seen all the choreographed moves before and the blind guy is just not believable. The amazing sets and cinematography with all the 'buke' backgrounds have all been done in the three previous films.

There is one long fight scene shot from an unusual angle which is the highlight of the film and really stands out, it's about 2/3 of the way through the film - I thought it was the finale, but no there was a lot more to come, but with that they'd peaked too soon. I spent a lot of the dialogue scenes looking at the the theatre roof - you think I was going to miss a key plot point by ignoring the hokey nonsense?

God knows what the 10 star ratings are about.

I'd give JW1 a 9, JW2 and 8, JW3 7.5.",3
paultenhout-140-413150,"A true John Wick fan here. Unfortunately, this is the least of the 4. What I liked about the other 3 was how the close combat was portrayed. 1 is a 9, 2 is a 10, and I give 3 an 8. S if I give 4 a 6. In John Wick 4 it is more in the open and it just doesn't feel the same. The fight scenes are just not as good as in the other movies. It's a decent film, especially the scene with Scott Adkins is good (he steels the show, give this man a spinoff or his own movie), and the scene with the shot from above is awesome. The cinematography is great, but it just doesn't give me the vibe that the other movies had.

However, a must see if you want to get closure for the franchise.",6
kjproulx,"I didn't expect much when John Wick hit theatres in 2014. I was shocked at how much fun I had with that film though and have enjoyed Chapters two and three almost just as much. The action has always been the reason to see these films and Keanu Reeves just being Keanu Reeves? C'mon, it doesn't get much more enjoyable than that. Well, John Wick: Chapter 4 has just hit theatres and it's not just my favourite John Wick film, it's one of my favourite straight-up mainstream action films in years. Here's why, especially if you've enjoyed the previous three, this one is a must-see.

Picking up relatively soon after the events of John Wick: Chapter 3, we see John Wick has pretty much recovered after an impossible feat at the end of that third film. He learns how to get to the High Table and also how he can be freed of being a wanted and hunted man, but new foes and many new armies will stop at nothing to take him down before he accomplishes that task. That's pretty much it for the plot, even though much more happens throughout the film that I will not spoil here. Without wasting any time though, I have to say that this film pulls no punches in its action or story for that matter. This is easily the most intricate story and the greatest action this franchise has given us yet.

At a run time that closes in on three hours, I never felt it. Every 20-30 minutes this film dives into action sequences that last a good 20 minutes each. On top of that, I have to commend the cinematography by Dan Laustsen, because this is some of the best-filmed action scenes I've seen in years. Yes, there are times when it starts to feel excessive, but that's usually right about the time that those sequences are concluding. The action never felt like it overstayed its welcome this time around. The action feels like a lot, but it also feels more sparse due to the long run time.

In the end, John Wick: Chapter 4 does a great job furthering this story, expanding on the mythology, and giving us somewhat of a conclusion to this franchise. I'm not sure where a fifth film could go from here. I've enjoyed the overdone performance by Keanu Reeves throughout the entire franchise and that is only accentuated here. Yes, as most of these films go, I've had issues with the screenplay in terms of the simplistic dialogue, but I honestly feel that it's just intentional at this point and therefore it made me enjoy this one even more. If a silly, well-crafted action flick can be a near-masterpiece, I'll say this comes close, but with a few minor issues. I loved watching this film.",9
jdticktalk,"I understand why this movie is getting 8 stars......it's because all the other movies out there are garbage! That's really not a good reason to give a movie 8 stars but that's the mess we're in today! This movie really is about nothing other than one scene of shooting violence after another.....prompted by an obscure company....supposed rules.....and obscure families competing with one another over nothing. The main character looks like a homeless person in a borrowed suit the entire movie......who can barely utter simple words like a caveman. This character gets attacked and shot at 50,000 times without injury until some silly duel the writers used for a conclusion. What's disturbing is how a dark movie.....purely composed of violence can get this many stars simply for that....and for an actor that belongs in a surfer movie. I give it 5 stars for the stunts, camera work, and animation.....because that's all there is.",5
Paragon240,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is an overwhelming feast of action brilliance! For the entire 2.5-hour runtime, this movie transitions from weapon to weapon, set piece to set piece, and spectacle to spectacle topping anything ever seen. The fight sequences never stop, and their beauty and intricacies drop jaw while breaking jaw. From the scene with the nunchucks to swords to shotguns to hatchets to hand-to-hand - among the greatest, if not the pinnacle, of action choreography. The cinematography creatively showcases each scene and battle, painting the action in bright colors and finding clever angles to keep the action fresh and engaging. As always, Reeves is incredible in the role, but the supporting cast of martial artists helps make this film what it is with experienced actors like Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins. But the absolute standout is Donnie Yen; his speed and skill are breathtaking as he steals every scene he is in. Unfortunately, despite all of its stunning brilliance, the story takes a lot of shortcuts to wrap up John Wick's story, which disappoints a little. The method to end it all seems like something that would have been mentioned several movies ago. But honestly, who cares? We don't go to a John Wick movie for a deep story. We go for the martial arts and gun-fu, and John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers an unparalleled masterpiece of violence.",9
Momozinho,"Can't believe so many people give this movie 5 and above (so many 10s :/) I honestly loved the 1st JW movie, liked n¬∞2 & 3 but this one, OMG! Just because the movie is filled with action scene doesn't make it a great movie. Honestly it's wayyyyyy too long, the rythm is bad, the John Wick character and arc are uninteresting as hell, other characters are under-developped, too many CGI, and OMG the ending just sucks a** There are some good fight scene in the movie, that can't be denied, but there are also way too many non-sense as well (e.g. The scene in the Berlin club where people keep dancing lik nothing is happening while bullets fly and axes are being burried in heads right and there, come on...). Don't know if this review will be helpful, be just be aware of the false hype. JW4 is not a good movie, sorry.",2
gurumachaz,"There's no spoilers here at all.

But to those who gave classic 7 to 10 stars review rating are obviously ""anything goes for my popcorn"" sort of audiences.

All I'm about to say is simple.

John Wick focuses around a man who wants to get out clean.

But dragged back by force and circumstances, he is forced to avenge for the fact he can't let go and to not be able to forgive and forget.

Forward to this very 4th installment, thinking it would surpass the 1st, or yet the 2nd, well at least the 3rd. But it fail miserably.

Miserably.

The fights are a mess versus the 3rd installment.

Meaningless action choreographed in its worst ever style of fights.

What gives it away ? The strength, trust, friendship and long lost signature of John Wick aren't present in this 4th installment.

It's just rubbish running about blindly, senseless gunning its way to the end.

The raging in John Wick 1st, even the 3rd is simply extraordinary, just not in this 4th chapter.

When a man goes through Hell, he drags the Hell long with him but in context of facing his foes, not to ruin the lives of those he pass through seeking guidance, or even solace.

To me, they (the filmmakers) simply made him classic evil, senseless, not capable to understand those who surrounds and support him.

He is no longer the man who's sent to kill the Boogeyman.

...and they used ""The Pianist"" Chopin Nocturne C sharp minor to represent Donnie's character ?! It's just embarrassing.

This film is nothing more than ""Pure disappointment""",3
TheDestroia,"9/10 Storytelling 8/10 Action 8/10 Overall

Excellent storytelling throughout by outstanding actors. Every scene is deliberately drawn out with thoughtful dialogue to reveal the nature of each character and their intentions with John Wick.

The action scenes are a combination of all of the previous installments with enemies new and old alike. A little variance in the killing is also present with a mixture of guns, melee weapons and environments.

Between all of the killing are the small moments that characters share with each other in dialogue, expressions and even just the musical track in the background. This really builds the character personalities for the small amount of screen time that some of them get making them truly memorable.

Not really necessary to see on the big screen unless you're really into killing sprees.",8
georgewhittingham1,"John Wick chapter 4 is without a doubt, the greatest ever action movie of our lifetime. The film, which runs at two a half hours, is relentless. 90% of this film is action, it barely gives you any time to breathe before moving on to the next fight.

And the action sequences themselves, are with out a doubt the best I've ever seen. Spanning multiple locations, we have insane gun fights, swordplay, hand to hand, car chases; even archery and as we've come to expect from Chapter 3, some dog killing sequences.

The story is actually pretty solid, with the only negative of the movie being the cheesey one liners from every character; but actually, I don't even mind - we know this is supposed to be fun and not take itself too seriously, and whilst Keanu himself in my opinion delivers his lines with incredible averageness, it almost adds to the movie. The sets themselves are also gorgeous, taking us from Japan to France, and not once are you disappointed with the scenery.

If you're a fan of action sequences, strap yourself in for the most incredible experience you'll ever have.",9
dmoorejr,"Stunning installment. Beautifully crafted action sequences. The camerawork is impeccable. The fight choreography is fantastic. Keanu continues to own the John Wick role. Donnie Yen bringing all his skills to the table. This sequel just ramps up everything this franchise represents. A Clean, sleek, modern action flick. This film is a masterclass of peak cinema. The set pieces are on another level. Insert more praise. This is the one. Definitely recommend checking this out. The cinematography alone is worth a watch. Real locations. The set design. It's peak. It's everything you want out of a movie.",9
LongTimeMovieLover,"If you want to watch fighting for 3H, beyond a rational setting, this is the movie to do it. I was well-produced, but it was almost exclusively fighting and shooting, mayhem for a long time, no police.

There was really not complexity to the story. I would give the story a 3 or 4, really, just nothing really there. However, because the action was good and I like Kineau Reeves, I gave it a 7/10.

Ian McShane is always fantastic, and Bill Skarsgard was a good arrogant villain. IP Man, Donnie Yen, was fine. The fight scenes were so long you could go to the bathroom and come back and it would still be going on, not missing much but more fighting.

I am not surprised about the high viewer ratings, but I am surprised by the high critics rating, because simply not a lot of story.",7
luyaj7,".......except the plot is even more predictable. 80% of the same O gun fight scenes. How many times can you do the same thing, so boring and repetitive? I get it, all gun and no plot is its genre but at least hire some decent writers. Barely any new action or gun scenes. The producers are just milking this cash cow dry to the bone. This movie was 1hr toooooo long also. The only good thing was the music had good bass and fit the scenes and only if you watched in Dolby with the vibration seats.

xmazmy,"I, just like many others, went in with high expectations because of the anticipation of this movie, and amazingly enough, did not disappoint as well as exceeded my expectations!

As a newcomer to the John Wick franchise, but having been aware of it for a very long time, I really love these films, particularly the first one. After watching Parabellum, and slightly wondering if the caliber and scope of it can be overtaken, I was gladly mistaken after seeing this film. The IMAX experience was breathtaking and impactful, so if given the opportunity, definitely don't miss out. But, watching it in a regular cinema is also equally good. While I don't want to spoil, I find that the movie felt way shorter than it's 2h 49m runtime, as I felt that Parabellum felt around 20 minutes too long. So if runtime worries you, I can assure you that it is not a problem, but a positive.

The movie left me highly satisfied and breathless, so massive props and respect to everyone involved in superseding the other entries and reinvigorating the action genre. It really feels like a once in a lifetime example of a genuinely impactful action movie. Please watch it and I feel that a 10 is worthy simply because of enjoyable nature, which the movie leans into. It does everything an incredible movie needs, and easily makes it one of the best movies as of late, and the apex of this amazing franchise! Also props to Keanu Reeves for inhabiting this character as well, as nobody brings it like him.",10
MackMonMay87,"The John Wick series started as a humble, nearly direct-to-video franchise that has risen to redefine the action genre in the 2010s til present. Most modern action/fight choreography in Hollywood at least owes itself to the Wick franchise and the incredible action design and direction of Chad Stahelski and David Leitch. John Wick 4 proves why their work can be imitated but not surpassed as they push the stunts, choreography, and spectacle to even further levels of well-shot, deliberately constructed insanity beyond any of the other installments.

I consider myself a fairly knowledgeable connoisseur of action, martial arts, and stunt-heavy films, and while it might be early to say given how new it is, John Wick 4 might be one of the best action films of all time. It's certainly one of the best of the last 10 years, even beyond the other films in the Wick franchise which are all at a high standard.

You have Keanu of course, the legendary Hiroyuki Sanada, the peerless Donnie Yen, greats like Scott Adkins (in an unforgettable role) and Marko Zaror, as well as the always excellent Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, Bill Skarsgaard, Clancy Brown and the gone-too-soon, classy and distinguished Lance Reddick, who always brought a level of distinction, refinement, and commitment to every project he touched. Newcomers Shamier Anderson and singer Rina Sawayama are also excellent additions to the franchise and bring a level of freshness and energy to each of their roles as well.

John Wick 4 is long, it's not a quick watch. That's one of the main flaws I can point to for the film. The issue is that there's so many satisfying action scenes that are so well set-up, it's tough to think of what you'd cut out. I can see why the finished cut was damn near 3 hours, which is a long time for a shoot-em-up with this straightforward of a plot.

For action fans, this demands to be seen at least twice. There's too many high-quality action scenes for it to be viewed once, so many well-made battles and set pieces all packed into one movie.

A single scene from John Wick 4 would be another film's action climax. Most movies are lucky to have even two sequences as well-designed as what you'll see here, much less an entire film of them.

The John Wick films also ooze style, with beautiful locations in Saudi Arabia, Japan, NYC, what appeared briefly to be London, and France. The lighting, particularly the Osaka scenes, is stunning. Stahelski is more than just an action director and knows how to make a gorgeous looking film that fills the big screen, where it should be seen.

The John Wick films aren't supposed to be realistic, they're action-spectacle and stuntwork taken to its absolute limit. They exist in a parallel, comic book-universe, so I can waive any criticisms about lack of realism or the more out-there elements. Realism isn't the only point of action films, it's the intensity, the feeling watching it gives you, and the craft that goes into making it.

Even the incidental kills John Wick does on nameless goons are well-choreographed. Nothing is lazy or done the easy way.

Other action productions should be looking at this and sweating, because they've raised the bar yet again. In the next year or two, you're going to see a lot of choreography that will imitate this, and it won't quite ring as true, won't quite have the same authenticity.

Kudos to Stahelski, Leitch, Keanu, and the rest of the incredible stunt team for piecing together a masterpiece of action. This could be a quality finishing point for the franchise, but would I be in the mood for another outing for Mr. Wick? To quote the man himself: "".... Yeah.""",9
Johansonn,"A devoid of fun, joyless, and worst of all BORING entry in the John Wick saga.

I can't for the life of me find any redeeming qualities in this movie.

All the new characters were uninteresting. And exactly the same as the ones in the previous movies.

1.) First movie, John has an old friend played by Willem Dafoe.

2.) Second movie, John has to repay the debt to an old friend mafia boss.

3.) Third movie, John has an old friend played by Berry.

4.) Forth movie John has two Japanese old friends, one blind.

All of them super-men and the bestest evah.

And even though the Bowery King is set up at the end of the previous movie as this hard*ore character bound for vengeance, in this one he does fudge all.

Even the shootouts and fight scenes were boring, as you know who will survive and all others are faceless stormtroopers.

I guess the one scene that was kind of fun was the up and down the stairs scene, but after 95% of the movie being uninteresting, I just didn't care.

Lastly the retcon at the end, telling the audience who is John Wick's father, was so pointless it was funny, in a useless way.",1
ivanjuarez-32826,"This is honestly the best John Wick film since Chapter 2. My grandpa and I saw it last Friday and yo, it was a blast for both of us because both are love with these action movies. You can try understand John Wick: Chapter 4 is somewhat different such as Caine, the deuteragonist, he's send to kill John which is antagonistic and deadly; but you latter come sympathize with him due to his goal to save his daughter from execution.

I personally respect him for giving Shimazu Koji a honorable death in battle, although Koji's daughter Akira wants revenge for that. Meanwhile with all the bounties and man-hunts, I'll say it's practically all Santino's fault for forfeiting John's life due to his desire to join the High Table and over run New York with the Camorra.",10
makatron,"It begins right at where chapter 3 ended, and John still trying to make the high table understand he wants to be left alone. And within a couple of minutes happens the only logical thing and bodies start piling up.

Without going into specifics you see stuff happen to the NYC Continental and the Bill Skarsg√•rd character recruiting, more like forcefully dragging one of John's old friends in order to get the job done, and at the same time we're introduced to the Tracker character that has a cute malinois with him because we know how much this franchise love dogs.

THE ACTION Set pieces are insanely paced and the movie never lift the foot off the gas that even though the movie has almost 3 hours you won't feel it at all. The whole chase in Paris has John dispatching henchmen with ease drifting around and dodging oncoming traffic as the High Table price on his head increases pulling even more assassins. There's an scene inside a house after that with an overhead shot that makes it look like a video game and the whole theatre was laughing at how John moved around using walls for cover and using dragon's breath shotgun shells (not a spoiler as it was in many trailers).

It's not every day that we see a franchise get better with each film, specially with a sleeper hit in 2014 that was my favourite film of that year with reason. Watch this movie in the biggest screen available and don't go for a large drink because even though it doesn't feel like it's 3h long, otherwise you'll be very uncomfortable before the credits.",10
sapronova,"I agree with others, it's the best one!

My personal best part that the production brought legends here Donnie Yen and Hiroyushi Sanada!

Omg! How happy I was to see them here! We should see more of those talented actors!

The storyline is very good here!

Action, fights choreography, locations! Visually just beautiful too! Really well done! Keanu also bravo! More fighting scenes instead of just shooting guns.

I usually write bad reviews, because unfortunately nowadays more garbage than good quality movies, so this one definitely deserves praise!!!

We need more good films and less waste of money and time kind of movies!",9
dorMancyx,"This is the level of action sequences and choreography designs that Marvel should be showcasing - all hail 87eleven! Barebow, katana, cane-sword, nunchaku, sniper rifle, metallic poker, blaster, dueling pistol, all manipulated in the most enthralling and incredible way, not as disposable tools, but as dopamine-full syringes that inject thrilling signals right down the thalamus. In particular, two combat scenes electrified me (no spoilers don't worry), the first being Caine's ""warmup"": his leisurely demeanor, ingenious gadgets, and breakneck motion swiftly establish a dangerous figure that actually might neutralize John Wick in his own movie. Bringing back memory of the blind monk from Rogue One, Donnie Yen's performance of Caine is exquisite, whether his gait, head movement, or battle style. The second scene that blew me away was John's slaughter in the suite, where a long shot follows the killing machine from above the ceiling through multiple rooms as he effortlessly obliterates his enemies with a freaking dragon's breath shotgun. Despite the ubiquitous usage of long takes to display flawless action designs, this scene tops it all off with inventive cinematography, and I love every bit of the RPG vibe it gives.

However, like Black Adam, constant fighting comes at a price, which in this case is shown through the characters, the story, and the plot progression. Mr. Nobody is a slightly redundant character, especially when compared to Caine, with an inconsistent motive and a forgettable presence. In my opinion, the part of this character could be entirely deleted to enrich Caine's connection with his daughter and with John, which would result in a more engaging final showdown - but, having Donnie Yen in this film is a blessing, so not a big complaint. However, the abundance of action sequences does perceptively make the plot simpler, as many of the events are deliberately arranged just to transition into another brawl. In the end, there is a point where the fighting fatigues, and I'm referring to the staircase scene: seeing John neymar his way down those steps he took such a long time to climb disrupts the momentum completely. Lastly, perhaps Keanu is a revered celebrity, but he is probably the worst actor in this movie: robotic line delivery, immutable facial expression, and the hairstyle that confuses John Wick with Neo from Matrix Resurrection.

Overall, one of the best action films of the decade, but an average movie in all other aspects.",7
dmerette,"I truly loved this movie. So much bad a** action. The music was just so awesome too. The fight scenes were just so cool, but I did think they lasted a little too long, and there is no way someone is walking away from what John Wick went through in all of it. It did run wayyyy too long on all of the fight scenes even tho they were great. I loved all the actors. This is just one of those great action movies that just hit the spot for me. The dog was a fun addition, and I assume that the person with the dog will show up again in future movies. I highly recommend this movie if action is your thing. Great fun.",9
tito_980,"As an action movie this is perfection, John Wick has always been true tu it's essence , it's not trying to be anything else that what it is !

This film delivers action at its purest state. The Berlin sequence it's just perfect , the music, the stunts , the characters and the John Wick universe has to stay here forever.

The biblical references and John's resolution are well stated. Do not try to analyze this movie as something that is not trying to be.

Remember what this franchise is all about, revenge, action, weapon skills, martial arts and most important of all, a Hitman's redemption story!

John Wick 4 delivers ! It's a 10/10 Thanks to all the genius behind this project , yo have made the best action film franchise in history .",10
chebattler-10531,"Contains spoilers.

I watched all 4 parts one by one in cinema. And starting from 1 to 4 it was getting worse. This part 4 looks like a joke parody on original.

Here we have a blind killer! Who is even more dangerous than Wick himself. This is ridiculous.

All those bulletproof suits. In the second part John got so much pain when someone shot him at least once into his armor. Now he does'nt feel like this is laser tag or something (not even paintbal).

John falls from 4 floor on a car and casually stands up and keeps running. He got smashed by car on full speed like 5 times, no problem. Cars in the center of the city hit people multiple times, no one even stops. They kill each other in the club noone cares. Even in computer games you have more realism than here.

Katana and sword fights when everyone have a gun. I know this is popular trick when Japan is concerned, but it looks quite not wise in this kind of movies.

Falling from the stairs reminded me of jokes about injured Neymar that is rolling infinitely. What a joke.

And last duel. Really? Duel with blind man.... Why? Why?? 3 hours, it got boring already, and now we get duel.

The first 3 parts were so good, comparing to this. I don't get why people put 10 stars to this. I just don't know.

This is my first review, but I just can't avoid writing how overhyped this movie is.

5 and only from respect to Mr Keanu.",5
ydzsnf,"Keanu delivers yet again on another masterpiece. The world building of the underworld here is ambitious and push out the scope of these films. It's hard not love what it is, an action movie with limited dialogue. But it you take it it for what it is... you will love every minute of its run time. Pacing isn't a problem since it grabs your attention immediately and never lets go. Stunning cinematography, incredible set pieces, choreography that stands heads and tails about any CGI today. This movie has it all. Absolutely a must watch in the theatres. It's a glorious love story to film making for everyone.",10
milosavljevicmiljan-93803,"The fight scenes are poorly done and you can see that the actors are waiting to attack and for Keanu Reeves to turn towards them. Keanu is slow and old. Cars hit him at least 4 times and he flew through the air unharmed, and the biggest stupidity is that everyone has bulletproof suits while protecting their heads with jacket sleeves. The end of the film is beautiful and the sunrise scene on the staircase is beautiful. It is absolutely unclear how Donnie Yen ""Caine"" managed to play cards, kill so many people with a gun and a sword and be completely blind. All in all, the movie is for children, but it can kill time for adults.",1
Kulin33,"In the words of the man himself ""Walk a mile to avoid a fight but when one starts don't back down an inch"" - Baba Yaga

John wick series has always been over the top action thriller focusing on getting the ultimate adrenalin rush to its viewers with best choreography action sequences than trying to tell the most compelling stories about Stylish assassins.

John Wick chapter 4 does justice to the characters and leaves room for future possibilities to branch out from the universe of John Wick. The movie keeps you engaged from the start with Loveable dogs, Guns and a man in black suit who wants to kill everyone. Plus he actually runs out of bullets and reloads the gun in between fight scenes.

It's astonishing how story is so driven to tell you and remind you again and again that Wick is the most baddest man in the world, he is called Baba Yaga for a reason

This movie is meant to be watched in a theatre with big screens and loud noises.

Remember Monsieur Wick has fought hard for it period.

Director Chad Stahelski has my gratitude for delivering this masterpiece and explaining me that without rules we are all animals.",9
sawoodward-93770,"Well I may have just watched one of the greatest action movies ever made. Keanu Reeves is a Legend. Give Donnie Yen as the blind hitman Caine his own movie. Scott Adkins is amazing as Killa. The nightclub scene with its slow build up tense card game than turns into a blazing orgy of violence through multiple dancefloors is a standout sequence.

Shamier Anderson is excellent as Mr Nobody who's dog deserves an award for best canine performance right now!

The scene at the end where a faceless female DJ with a sultry voice speaks over the airwaves encouraging the bad guys to go after Wick whilst playing some groovy tunes was clearly influenced by The Warriors.

cmkdakota-65369,"I really don't understand how this movie garnered such a high score. I felt like I was in a Star Wars sequel with people either running or being shot at for almost 3 hours. Cinematography was fabulous and it did take you to other countries in a realistic and enjoyable way, however, so if you could sit back and enjoy that, it was worth it.

I believe Keanu Reeves' immortality outperformed Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapon series after being shot about 84 times, thrown down flights of stairs multiple times and off buildings - and no - the Kevlar suit wasn't convincing to me.

Whereas blind people can do amazing things, Reeves' love-hate relationship with a former friend was not convincing.

In college, I learned that fiction still works if it is at least somewhat believable in its own setting. This one missed the mark.",6
aparra-33808,"I wanted to like this movie so badly. The first three were great, albeit gradually declining in quality throughout the series. I was excited and hopeful for the fourth installment but couldn't have been let down more. The action was boring by mid film and there was still another hour and a half to go at that point. This movie is ten minutes shy of three hours long. The fight scenes go on way longer than they need to, moves are repeated over and over and the plot armor of JW becomes laughable. If you like the film because John is a regular guy with crazy skills, you'll hate this. If you see him as some kind of superhero then you'll probably enjoy it. The guy legit falls out of 5 story buildings onto stone roadways and just rolls over and gets up. It felt insulting to my intelligence.",4
ha77y73ad97,"For nearly 10 years we have been treated to the joy that are the John Wick movies. The nicest guy in hollywood has been able to reinvent himself into one of the baddest hitmen ever to be played on screen! The 4th installment is no exception.

Ive seen a lot of reviews and reports surrounding this movie and the state that John Wick had found himself in the last 2 installments. Wick 2 i would say hes fighting at 30% hp and Parabellum around 1hp and still managing to slay very time. This time round hes back to full health and ready to take on everyone who stands in his way.

With the sudden passing of Lance Reddick im sure they had multiple stories for his character as it sounded very much from the press tour that his character was going to be round for a while after this movie. Nonetheless he went out in the way that his character has always been, dignified.

Less just say one thing that the villain of any movie deserves credit for making a movie just as epic as it can be and Bill Skarsg√•rd is no exception here. Typical man at the top that gets everyone else to do his dirty work. Clancy browns Harbinger is awesome and a great addition to the mystery that surrounds the world of the hitman for hire.

I cannot fault this film yet again, action movies for years to come will be looking back on this to create an epic fight scene half as well as the smallest of scenes in this film. Just one more thing to say that a fight scene between 2 factions of Ninjas is just as epic as ever before.",10

But there's a comedic humour at how OTT and cringe this movie is that makes it enjoyable to a point, that point is not the length of this! Felt like I was in the cinema for days.

The action is repetitive and ridiculous, the main issue is 99% of the individual moments would kill anyone yet these people get up, they use their arms and hands to block bullets but justify it with Kevlar clothing, get hit by 5 cars? That's ok back on your feet.

In terms of a spectacle where they get ridiculous over the top sets just to have mediocre fights, it's great, for ironic enjoyment it's brilliantly done but as a serious movie it's a flat 0/10.",5
alkhanahmed,"Full disclosure, I fell asleep in the last 10 minutes in the theatre, so my review of won't take the final act into consideration, (but if I'm falling asleep I usually don't take that as a good sign).

The action and fight choreography is really good, but even that has some flaws, they're really drawn out, and some attacks are too repetitive (eg; John wick gets hit by a car at least 3 times in the same action scene, and he falls down stairs twice in a different scene).

Other cons include:
The man and his daughter from Osaka, were built up to be a part of the story but then never mentioned again after the train scene in Osaka (I get that the father dies but at least have the daughter do more).


-The movie is too long, nothing against long movies, but this one didn't need to be this long, scenes were drawn out and too many characters were so needless if you took them out it wouldn't change the directory of the story.

when the actions scenes were happening I found it funny how the dancers in the club or the people sitting in the restaurants in France were just acting normally, when there's a literal gunfight happening in front of them.",6
connorpearl-72679,"I love the John Wick movies. They are unapologetically badass. Suspension of disbelief is required, but if you submit yourself to the experience, it's a ride unlike any other in modern cinema.

This film is truly everything great about the first 3 films turned up to 11. The story, tho somewhat secondary to the action/cinematography, is a fitting fourth chapter to this saga. The new characters are the best to be introduced yet out of all the films. Caine, Akira, Mr Nobody and his dog; they are interesting, exciting, mysterious, and above all, badass.

The star of the show however is obviously the fight choreography and the cinematography. It's what makes this film. Like the others, this film is drenched in neon style and is clearly influenced by Bladerunner and the like. It's amazing. The long shots, the still shots, the camera angles (that one long bird's eye scene, wow) the lighting. This is truly more than just an action movie. There's an appreciation for elevated filmmaking and the art of film that is on full display here. It's ""elevated action"" if you want to come up with a genre.

The fight choreography is unsurprisingly perfect. The amount of jaw dropping kills was ridiculous. You know when someone is just so absurdly cool you can't help but laugh out loud? Every extended fight scene had handfuls of these moments. Scorsese famously stated that the marvel films weren't cinema, they were amusement rides. I know he was offering a jab, but this film to me was the best of both world. I felt like I was riding a ride at an amusement park, blown away by the views at the top, and laughing at the excitement of the more exhilarating parts.

Fantastic movie, probably the best action film of the 21st century (yes, better than mad max) and an achievement of making just a damn enjoyable movie. 10/10, A+, 5 stars, the whole shebang.",10

Apparently, the plot is that the 'High Table come for John', but it felt like the plot was just for John Wick to rack up a higher kill count than Topper Harley (which is 389 by the way).

Then there's the injury continuity:- Bad guy gets hit by a car-dead John Wick gets hit by a car-nothing Bad guy falls off the edge-dead John Wick falls from a 3 story building onto the roof of a van-nothing.

circa-cdxliv,"I'm gonna need more than that y'all. This was a 3hr fight scene. You added nothing to the story. If anything, you took us further out from the center. You're introducing characters that don't make any sense. E.g. The Tracker...who is that guy? Where does he come from?

Pennywise- you tell us he was brought in by the high table and given power because he guaranteed a John Wick kill. Ok...how does such a man come to be? Why would the high table entrust that to him? Why would he then entrust that with Mr. Nobody? If your answer is because he could track JW...then why is he the only one that could? Until he wasn't. Because it seemed like there was no problem for Caine & the high table goons to find him.

It was just a bunch of nonsensical stickers on a board. Like a Xmas tree - where the tree is all the fighting scenes and the characters and little bit of story are the ornaments you hung on it in the most random, non sequential order.

We're 4 movies in and you still haven't told us anything substantial about the high table. Who are the founders? When was it founded? What's it's purpose?

Other questions:

Why didn't JW just kill Pennywise? He's killed 3 high table people already. What's stopping him from killing this guy?

Why kill Lance and not McShane? Why keep him alive? How much of a problem is he allowed to be?

What's the point of Fishburne if he's not going to be more involved? Didn't he want payback too? All he did was bring JW a suit.

""When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga.

This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. ""

""Who needs a 2hr and 40 min action movie? No one. Yes the action was good, but repeats so many times that it becomes so boring. How can hundreds of assassins not kill one man?""

""Seems after coming up with the bullet proof suit the writers etc thought it a good idea to make sure everyone has one. These giant men sent to kill Wick all wearing suits, raising the jacket to protect their heads was a sight I found so funny""

Same scenese were funnish. It wasn't necessary. Also, the shooting scenes were very good. At the same time, the disco scene, the scene shot from above, looked very epic.

851222,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""John Wick: Chapter 4"" (2023) played out the way one could expect from this franchise in term of plausibility. It is unrealistic in every possible way, yet its made in a way that it looks real. And this is the biggest strength of Chapter 4. You have to leave all plausibility at the door before watching it. Because when the movie starts - you are in for one unforgettable ride.

Not only Chapter 4 is the best from the 4 movies now, it also puts to shame all action films I've seen in many years. Its incredible movie on purely moviemaking terms. Stunt team, choreography of fights, chases and kinetic cinematography are all put in a way I don't think I haven't seen in Hollywood action film yet. I won't spoil anything, but one particular action set piece near the end left me with my jaw dropped - the way it was filmed looked kinda like a video game but so amazing at the same time. Creators really outdone themselves with this film. And action aside (and there is more then enough of it), i loved how confidently this movie was directed.

Overall, ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is the best action film I've seen in many years. Reminded me of ""Raid 2"" but with bigger scale and way bigger budget. This one has to be seen on big screen - this one incredible action film. And running time almost 3 hours didn't felt draggy - its superbly paced. One of the very best films of the year so far.",10
mentemalleo,"After a pretty pathetic JW3, this sequel does deliver. JW3 suffered from boring and repetitive fight scenes: it seemed like a video game where headshot quantity was important. I literally fell asleep around 90 min in. JW4 recovers nicely, and is definitely worth seeing. A much better plot, with great and well-choreographed fight scenes. The spice is back. And great, aggressive cinematography, too. Eye candy, with attractive on location shots from Berlin and Paris. Yes, there is the obligatory empowered female fighter, but her role is limited to killing only 10-12 300 lb mercenaries. And the obligatory white male villain, but good news! He's French! So we can despise him regardless of sex or ethnicity. Of course it's not a JW sequel unless the laws of physics are suspended, but if you buy the premise, you'll buy the gag. Worth the watch.",8
neilaheaton,"It's definitely not the best of the 4. No question about that but it's alright. I read some of the reviews around and I do agree with the plot holes that most have recognised. Most notably the fight scenes in the night club.

Literally hundreds of people dancing while wick fodder get an axe into the head or machete up the nose or whatever. I could write chapters on how the fight scenes are nonsense if you really want to analyse it.... But If you've watched the first three and still have feelings of incredulity then seriously what's wrong with you?

It's John Wick he shoots people in the face for 2 hours and says ""Yea!!!"" Yes it's regurgitation of all the previous but what did you want? John Wick working at an animal shelter and trying to save the planet.

It's not brilliant but if you are like me and are a fan of JW then you won't be disappointed. You just go into that world for a couple of hours and you get what you paid for.

Also I really should give it a 10 for the tribute to the warriors but he didn't fight the baseball fury's Also I think they upgraded the tech that the girls use. I didn't see a Commodore 64 None the less. It's a solid film and JW shoots a lot of people in the face. I hope there's a JW5.",7
ohadlu,"John wick is a power house of action movie franchise, 1-3 were incredible for being an advancement in cinematography and choreography and incredible stunt work, so when they announced a fourth one, well, I was anticipating yet another awesome movie.

I was... Half wrong; while giving me the action I wanted they stretched it for 3 hours with dead unimportant dialogue. 0 emotion.

Every time they built tension in a scene and they stretched it too long, making the tension tiresome and boring, leaving me waiting for the action scenes to keep the plot going.

In conclusion, for a fourth film that concludes a series, like the matrix, they should've let it go at the 3rd film.",6
ceylanmehmetakif,"I hadn't seen an action movie that Entertained me so much of me in a long time.

John wick and stunt performance was very good.

I liked that the action scenes were long.

The effects were great And it was so violent, I loved it

We entered the cinema in a suit, everyone started taking our pictures, it was very funny.

The reason that the best john wick movie, in my opinion, is that they've improved a lot in the action scenes and the story is more believable and the characters are deeper.

And they finished john wick very well, they couldn't have finished better than this I liked it so much and I can go to the cinema again.",10
JohnP123,"Having watched all the prequels to this high octane action film .I was excited for the sequel to be released in the theatres shortly ,having gotten the opportunity to watch an early screening of the film before its theatrical release I was hyped as I had read somewhere that this time the bogeyman takes on the high table itself . And believe me I was not disappointed though a bit slow paced at the beginning the moment John Wick start on a killing spree the action sequences, gunfights are so good and satisfying that it kept me to the edge of the seat and willing to cheer him for every enemy he takes down. Donnie yen, Scott Adkins, Hiroyuki Sanada were icing on the cake.",10
bhernandez2216,"Wow!! This movie brings so many action and stunts when it comes to Keanu Reeves as John Wick! I really love this movie 100% without a doubt, and every John Wick movies never disappoint at all.

What I really loved about John Wick is Keanu Reeves as he does he's best with his every action movies he was in, and Donnie Yen did a solid job as well with his best work. John Wick: Chapter 4, brings so many best action fights, stunts, and every best moments it has been delivered to the big screen!

This movie is why we should all watch in the cinemas, because if you see any type of action movies like John Wick, you'll probably understand why we love going to the movies to experience all the action for the rest of your life!

Totally recommend watching all John Wick movies!!!

10/10.",10
bookchawi,"Alright, so I saw John Wick 4 last night, and I feel like it's my obligation to issue a fair warning... it is not as good/perfect as the ""ratings"" want you to believe. Read the negative reviews, they have merit.

Before going to see Chapter 4, I rewatched the first 3 and was totally swept off my feet, again! The 4th is a redundant, emotionless, farcical disappointment that fails to advance the story, yet alone resolve it. SO MUCH POTENTIAL after the 3rd one to witness John recover, exact revenge on his betrayers, and peel back the curtain of the high table: doesn't happen. Weak-weak-weak storyline with plot contrivances galore.

There is only one action scene that stood out that is maybe the most memorable of the series... and one driving scene with some of the sickest tracking shots I've ever seen... but just be prepared to watch hours of nonsense for those 15 min of magic. But was there cool fighting throughout? Yes, but it falls flat because it is so absurdly unrealistic and tedious without any grounding sense of purpose. Not trying to deter you from seeing it. Just advising you to lower your expectations so that maybe you can enjoy it for what it is.",6
penofinspiratin,"The 1st movie was epic because it was well thought out, the storyline had no loophole, you understood why each character did what they did & left the cinema satiesfied

The camera did a wonderful job in blending the choreography of gun-fu & the ending was satisfactory.

Chapter 2 still had some juice in it but, I knew then that chapter 3 is not on my cinema watching list.

As soon as I saw it, I said to myself this is as what fast n furious 9 is to the whole FF-franchise. Pointless, no storyline, just more layers to a live action future console game idea

Chapter 4 to me would have done great if we got to see who the high table is, how Baba yaga was born, how he retired, how he met & lost his beloved wife & then we get to see how bad ass the high table, is perhaps send it's best & yes get to see wick die.

My problem with this film is how you can clearly see that the actors are fighting a choreographed dance.

No one shoots when Wick is out of ammo, no one attacks when wick is busy with an opponent.

Wick fights for over 20mins in a public space & there is no police reaction.

He hasn't ate since chapter 2 & has fallen off building, hit by cars, lost fingers & never slept But still, take out an entire mob of amatuers & what's worse is how he acts like he is mimicking John wick when he is John wick ""YEAH""

I hate the fact that everyone breaks code & rules when wick is right under their nose, they waste time, make silly mistakes or have their livelihood destroyed

We where told the high-table has top tier contractors but they send a spoilt brat. Lyk wtf? How is he even their best choice

Don't get me started on the blind guy, I knew he was just a male version of the mute lady in chapter 2 The idea was fair but he was just too much, even daredevil can't do what the guy did.

So much stuff was just ridiculous I thought wow this is the worst wick

& lo everyone is screaming it's the best thing in Hollywood right now.",3
kaloyan-yankov,"I don't want to leave the impression that I hated everything about this movie, so I will start with some of the good things.

Some of the scenes had amazing cinematography and were really fun to watch, as well as is expected from a John Wick movie, the fight scenes can have really good choreography.

What I don't understand is if the idea for this movie is to be a parody of itself.

John is killing wave after wave of unnamed henchmen, being kicked and hit multiple times but never stopping, even tumbling down 200 starirs TWICE was not enough to stop him, it was just ridiculous.

It had its fun moments, but the movie was just toooo long and too unrealistic. No idea how it has a 8.5 rating.",6
deeoo,"Yes, I watched all 4 movies.

No, I didn't like any of them.

Yes, that makes no sense.

No, I can't explain.

Somehow, I hoped the next iteration of this series would be different. Have more story. Make more sense. But all 4 movies are well made fight scenes with a bit of story added to make it into a movie.

Now it did my head in how these movies get such high rating. Then it dawned on me that kids these days love watching others play games like Roblox or Call of Duty. This movie is tailor-made for these audiences.

The movie feels like a game with a bit of story with a bit of acting and then you fight. Kill all the bad guys from level 1 and unlock the story-scene toward level 2 until you get to the end boss.

So my 4-stars are based on this being a movie. It's slick and looks good, so that's 4 stars. But the other ingredients a movie needs, like acting, storyline and character development, are non-existent.",4
Moah-505q,"Alright, buckle up, folks! We've got a wild ride ahead of us with ""John Wick: Chapter 4""! This movie is like a high-octane thrill ride that never lets up, with Keanu Reeves reprising his role as the legendary assassin John Wick.

First things first, the action scenes are absolutely insane! From the opening sequence to the final showdown, the fight choreography is top-notch and will leave you on the edge of your seat. It's like a symphony of bullets, punches, and kicks that will make your heart race and your adrenaline pump.

But it's not just mindless action, folks. The story is actually pretty darn good too! Without giving away any spoilers, let's just say that John Wick has some serious scores to settle and he's not messing around. The plot is full of twists and turns, and you'll never know what's coming next.

And let's not forget about the supporting cast. And don't even get me started on the new additions to the franchise, like Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada. These guys are absolute badasses and bring a whole new level of intensity to the movie.

Overall, ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is a wild, action-packed ride that will leave you breathless. It's got everything you could want in an action movie - amazing fight scenes, a killer story, and a fantastic cast. So grab some popcorn, buckle up, and get ready to witness one of the most epic action movies of all time!",10
avgmovieenjoyer,"To be honest, John Wick 3 was kind of a letdown for me, as that movie wasn't as engaging as the previous two. But the newest one in the installment overcompensates for the many flaws of the previous movie. It is by far the best John Wick movie ever. It is one of the best action movies ever, as well.

The action shots here are stunning and breathtaking. I can't even decide which one is my favourite. Is it the one at the very beginning of the movie, where the hotel is attacked by many High Table hitmen? Is it the one that took place in the middle of the road where the danger of them being run over by a car was present as well? Or is it the one that happened at the stairs of the church?

Seriously, all 3 of them were equally as good. And they managed to keep me engaged throughout the entire 3 hour runtime of the movie. There wasn't a single second where I felt bored or the need to be entertained.

The only flaw of this movie is the dialogues between John Wick and the rest of the characters. Literally, most of his words on the script are ""Yeah"" and ""I understand"". But even the only weakness of the movie is easily ignorable.

PLEASE, watch this movie as soon as possible!",9
yelrek,"This is hard to write. I'm a huge Keanu fan as well as the Wick character. However, this 4th installment left me wanting and at times checking the clock during the show. You have probably already read that the action and fighting is good. It is, but it's not new or innovative. Assuming you've seen the first 3? There's guns, hand to hand, cool use of the environment, lots of bullet proof clothing and ineffective hits, a dog and some of the other Wick tropes. I guess I was expecting another new style or sweet scenario. I enjoyed the movie, but was expecting a Wick experience and instead got a, 'quest for more money' type of vibe where the scenes and situations seemed repetitive. I suggest seeing the flick, just temper your expectations and hope they don't unequivocally jump the shark on a 5th. Wick is great, but it's not a franchise to simply repeat and this installment feels like the beginning of that.",5
logannugen,"The movie is really fun and action pack. Incredible bird-eye view scene at the end Wow!. The duel was fantastic too.

But in an action movie, you need to feel danger to enjoy it. They make John look invincible, like jump out of a tall building smashing into a car and nothing happened. It also unnecessary, he could have slide down a pole or run down the stairs. Many scenes are like that which can easily tone down to make it more human and creating a sense of danger. Chidi (Marko Zaror) character is the same, he seems invincible from falling and gun shot too.

Many people think the blind duel is silly but that's because they're not blind. It actually amazing, the blind can hear your foot step on the rocks and know exactly the direction to aim, if they standing still, which is in this case. So for me, that battle is believable and amazing.

The movie try to be comedic but it doesn't stick until the end. I can see they tried to be funny with the fight scenes in the beginning, but the tone of the situation is so serious I couldn't laugh. At the end, the comedy finally stick and everyone in the cinema laugh.

Overall it's a great fun enjoyable movie to be watch on a big screen. If they could tone down a bit and make John a little more human, don't make him fall or jump out of a tall building with no scratches on him, or blocking the bullet by lifting up your suit jacket, then it would make the movie even better.",7
EdwardtheBlackPrince,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is the conclusion to the franchise. John sets out to prepare for his war against the High Table, and be free from all this once and for all. However, the job isn't going to be an easy one and all those close to him are caught in the crosshairs and old friends turned rivals are involved in the matter. John wicks' chapter 4 is nothing short of an epic action if the term can apply to action films. Its film it's ushering a fresh light on the genre from its stunts to the fight choreography and high tension. Which continues throughout these movies including this one. The chapter is by all means the best out of the four films since the first. It sets up the situation and throws you off on this thriller of a ride. With the 4th film, not much can be said that hasn't been said about the previous installments. Action is amazing fast paced, and excellent stunt work. Great performance from the cast Keanu Reeves you know him you love as John, Ian McShane, and The late Lance Reddicks. The new cast while Parabellum did a good job of setting up the grand finale. It didn't have the most interesting dialogue. The Adjudicator this woman was not at all interesting and took away a lot of the awe and charm of the mystery of the Table. Here was given Bill Skarsg√•rd as The Marquee. He carries more than a traditional shadow figurine showing that this is a guy who has a lot of power calm and is calculated but won't lift a finger and do his dirty work. He's a face you can love to hate So are the side characters Donnie Yen is arguably the best character in the film as he plays a blind swordsman named Cain. He has his reason for wanting john dead, but in many, he's conflicted on the matter. Some of the more somber moments of the film between him and John are compelling. And of course, he's a badass. Fast and on his feet, kind of out stages John in some scenes. They do a very great job and creative ways of showing how he fights.s There's also another guy after John simply called Mr. Nobody who doesn't have any Vendetta against John. He's just a guy trying to collect on John's head., but he's so frequent in the movie and when he's now on screen with his dog he's a charming guy. The visuals are stunningly beautifully shot very well-lit, amazing camera angles. There's one shootout with an overhead view and it's a straight-up video game it's awesome. The only cons that could be made about the movie are the run time. Unlike Parabellum where it just got so carried away with the action that it started to become desensitizing. And the between scenes were lackluster. Here it trying to wrap up the series your gonna want to go all out. Conclude Character arcs and all that. So it's understandable, and I have so invested in the film that it didn't bother me personally. Overall if you enjoy the last 3 films you'll love this story.",8
mbrown-96818,"While I understand this is an action movie borne from fiction, I'm not sure what the director was looking to achieve here.

Was this meant to be a video game brought to screen? Where the player, or in this case the protagonist John Wick, remains impervious to pain, fatigue or mortality while racking up a zombie apocalypse level kill count.

The plot had been set in the 3 movies leading to this final chapter...(for the sake of the franchise, surely he ain't dead or at least there's a John Wick Jnr he forgot about while he was out collecting bounties) However, I'm not sure if we are meant to have deduced that a utopia has been established by an overarching High Table, replacing the law as the civilian authority.

Mercenaries appear to have replaced NYC finest or the French Gendarmerie by the time this chapter rolled around, but we are left to deduce that this must be the case? Not a law enforcement officer was in sight, despite a rising body count across the cities, and a building being levelled. Nothing to see here, move right along... Even the ultimate mercenary 'Leon' in 'The Professional', ultimately came under notice before the authorities mobilised to stop one mans will to avenge the wrongs of society.

Action? Non-stop. And there were some big scenes, many being created in a digital studio.

We move from a crowded Arc De Triomphe, with carnage all around, but no distressed citizens. Just going about their commute blasting their horns at the gun wielding pedestrians.

The night Club scene appeared to be one borne to support the visual storyline narrative as opposed to anything close to reality. Clubbers continued to be 'slaves to the rhythm', despite everyone else participating in battle and bloodlust, at a level last seen in Braveheart.

Special mention to the scene covering the 220 stairs leading up to the Sacr√© Coeur in Paris, well it was up there with the ""bug"" kill in Starship Troopers.

It's a movie that's borrowed heavily from celluloid genre, Action, the Western, and the Anti-Hero, but using technology to replace John Ford like panoramas.

It was like ChatGPT had been asked to write an action movie script, you know it's fake but you just accept it and settle in for the ride.",5
pauls-25727,"I just have to give this chapter of John Wick 8/10.

The action set pieces are absolutely incredible and some choreography must've taken days if not weeks to get everyone prepared for the scenes but some of the fights show how it could've been done tighter ie an enemy in armour waits staggering about for Keanu to return and finish him off...keep an eye out and you'll notice this a few times.

The inclusion of the new characters brings freshness to the movie and the don't feel out of place could've done with a bit more of a background to them though.

John is carrying on his journey for freedom while taking on the Marquis DeGramont & his henchmen to arrive at a certain destination by sunrise and the journey there is just non stop action.

The pacing of the movie runs perfectly and you never get tired or bored, each set piece shot perfectly near enough especially the Arc De Triomph

The ending of the movie is and will be decisive to people and for me I'm happy with the ending and hope they end it here...don't know what to think about the end credit scene though !

If you loved the first 3 in this franchise then I believe you'll thoroughly enjoy this chapter from Mr Reeves and Mr Stahlelski.",8
stingrayfins,"I can see why people love it and I can see why people hate it. People want different things out of a movie and John Wick 4 delivers exceptionally well in certain areas while being mediocre in others.

A quick summary is I had a fking great time watching it at some points and a little bored during others. The action scenes are fantastic. It's a TON of fun and really cool to watch. A little towards the middle of the film it did feel a bit slow and dragged out. Cutting out 15 mins would be perfect.

Held up by good action and decent laughs is the weak story. I absolutely LOVE the idea of the underground black market, the continentals, and the high table. I wish we got to see more of that world. I wanted more backstory, more exposure, more display of how they ran behind the scenes. Hopefully I'll get to see that in the Ballerina and Continental.

The other thing I think hindered the movie was that the idea of the high table got watered down. They started off as some serious group that mean business that you don't want to mess with. In John Wick 4 I felt like they were kind of a joke and not really as big as mean as people made them out to be. John Wick was just so broken in the 4th chapter. I know it's the whole appeal of John Wick but it does take away from the story and suspense when, even with suspension of disbelief, is just pure absolute absurdity. But that's also why I love it!

I swear John Wick can take more hits than some Avengers. He's like a tank with the body of Wolverine.

But regardless of what you're looking for you have to give it to the crew for how much work and dedication they put in to this movie. The quality really shows here. It's just really fun and exciting to watch. I rate it higher than the other John Wick films even though it's not my favorite just because in 9 out of 10 ways it's bigger and better.

But I love the other John Wick films because we got more backstory, more Continental, and more focus on story.",8
GryeD,"I consider this in my top 10 movies of all time. This film is absolute perfection and the 4th film of the franchise did not dissapoint, it only improved. Everything about it from the action, comedy, story, and development feel just right. The fact the movie is very long only makes it even better to remember. I was curious how John Wick was going to top off the 3rd film, but the 4th was a massive improvement. I found myself just paying absolute attention to the action packed epicness John WIck was providing for me.

John Wick is one of the few movie franchises I will consider buying merchandise for.",10
austinonifc,"First I gotta say this is the best of the franchise forsure. Definitely the best action movie I've ever seen. Filled with the most violence fit into one movie ( and not because it's 3 hours) it fits soo many creative/unique violence that feels like a video game than a movie in the best way. I had a great time watching John Wick 1,2 and 3 but 4 was the funnest of all and probably my favorite movie theater experience. Seeing Wick kill on the big screen with big sound is what makes the experience a lot better. The movie also is filled with beautiful shots and locations all throughout. Awesome color schemes, beautiful castles, everywhere they're at just looks badass. We get more of a Kung Fu side to this thanks to Donnie Yen, which kicks ass in this he's just as great as John Wick in this. We get a couple more villains in this that all want to take John Wick out soo that gives us Triple the violence. The movies 3 hours but it goes by because of all the intensity throughout. Go out and Enjoy this Trust me !!",10
ayushganguli,"Story, Cinematograhy, Music, Performances and the most important thing in a film of this genre ACTION, all are done with perfection.

And the cast is also superb, all are giving their best. Each action setpiece is All time great. Dialogues which are few but really awesome. Music also uplifts each scene and the final hour of this movie is going to go down as one of the best third acts ever. And undoubtedly it is the BEST ACTION FILM EVER MADE surpassing all the great ones Like T2, The matrix or die hard and a decade later from now on it will remembered as an iconic film and John Wick franchise is the best action franchise ever made.",10

PedroPires90,"Due to its universe's plausibility over statements and limited plots, I never feel high stakes, so I can't create the emotional connection needed to go beyond 4 stars. But forget that. This is the best John Wick ever.

This is very close to perfection within the potentialities of this expanded Universe. Set pieces are more impressive than ever - I don't even know which one to mention! -, incredible choreography, funny moments, exciting and well-built new characters and a world on steroids that seems to have no end. Reeves with a more characteristic John Wick than ever - although sometimes his reactions resemble those of Roy Kent in...Ted Lasso -, incredible scenarios and locations, beautiful photography and an excellent soundtrack. There's an interior scene all shot top-down that is magnificent!

In technical terms, a hymn to the cinema. Super entertaining.

PS: Skarsg√§rd's accent is one of the worst in cinema history.",8
EvanKevelson,"Too long great finale not as good as 1-3 John Wick if comparable in entertainment value is the Die Hard 1-4 of our day in terms of the adrenaline and underlying dark humor.

However the action is ultimately what it's all been about as one is left with a myriad of questions into the mythology and other characters from 2 & 3 that leave some people like myself with some frustration.

My primary question in 3, is that after 2 thee was tremendous significance placed on the marker with equal emphasis on the infallibility of the High Table.

You have Sontino D'antonio utilizing a marker to eliminate his sister who is member of the high table.

Now there is nothing in 3 definitely not 4 that resolves this issue leaving the viewer to come up with their own hypothesis to fit into the events.

The high Table not the Gamorah come after John after Santino is deservedly slain yet he is rewarded for sanctioning the hit on his sister? We know a record of markers and currencies are part of the neutral ground and sanctuaries of the continental chain of hotels.

The high table perhaps then saw her assassination as an internal dispute as to who should be at the seat belonging to them.

Perhaps since Santino was killed without an order it is viewed differently the contract is out of territories belonging to that family and is seen as disrespectful to the table. It's a tight fit but grants it coherence. If approached more strategically perhaps Mr Wick could have had the Santino bounty removed and left him to be dealt with on the level of the table. Taking his rightful anger out and doing so in the continental does threaten the structure. For the type of film I can be fine with that.

Now after three you're left to wonder what's the deal with Angelica Houston & Halle Berry. Halle Berry I assume is pardoned at the outset because of the marker, Her old boss may be under no obligation to kill him but it's his discretion ok... but then she creates her own problem what's her status?

At the opening of this film one assumes that the previous elder is deposed for underestimating or misreading John, and perhaps being unaware of the amount of influence Winston has over John leading to a debacle. One can assume the adjudicator is dealt with as the concierge and Winston were.

The end of three one assumes the ""Bowery King"" though operating more independently still cannot defy the table... 1. Do they believe he is dead because nobody is hunting him or they believe the seven cuts killed him...that would be fine if Winston wasn't aware but if Winston is aware the Table has to be aware... 2. The point is strengthened via the ""Tracker"" and desanctqfication of the Osaka Continental...somehow they believe or knew after the elder John was in Japan. Like the approach to Santino killing the new elder did not seam to be well thought out.

3. John clearly could have ended Caine in the Osaka but did not.

4. Why this Marquis guy as opposed to the Mafia or Gemorah?

5. The open contract has competition killing each other for 25 million making John's chance of survival more realistic.

It's true that John is ""addicted to the vengeance"" is a man with nothing to lose, and once Helen died if not his dog or car unless he met another would have found some reason to relapse.

Because if he wanted to survive he merely could have disappeared after falling off the roof....he didn't go for Winston nor does it indicate that he planned on it and that would have been the only unsettled score for John. Taking on the Table was motivated by Winston. Continuing after the roof could be a debt to the Bowery King for saving his life and getting him back to health.

The dialogue exchanges in the first three were significantly more entertaining than in this installment outside of the card game in Berlin.

What this movie had even over the third was the cinematography and scenery. This installment was designed to be appreciated from an IMAX screen.

It's clear 30 minutes in that the ""story"" really ended at the end of Chapter three (Really Chapter 2- John Wick could have been a solo movie in itself as was indicated by after retrieving his car and burying his currency again that in his mind he was finished).

Had they made the ""Resistance"" more integral, filled in the status of the Moroccan continental, or even explained where or what happened to his second dog there'd have been continuity.

This movie should be ""The Finalization of the Table"" because it was about John from their perspective not from his own.

I was frustrated having to wait for a fourth they didn't turn it into Alien or Rocky thank goodness, but waiting 3.5 years purely a visual wonder. Excellent choreography music etc... but the characters and story were pretty much completed in Chapter 3.",8
MattiPajumaa,"Was rather hesitant about the almost 3 hour runtime, and it did become a factor. Let's just face it, the fight scenes are too long. No doubt they are well made, but it's just too much. Plus though for the variation.

You also had to suspend your belief even more in this than the earlier iterations. Here Wick is superhero-like in his ability to endure pain and withstand bullets using his coat (?)

Skarsg√•rd as the Marquis didn't work for me, should have been casted differently. Good to see Lance Reddick in the beginning, he was such a classy actor in the first movies.

The locations and sets are nice, and good to see that not everything gets solved with cgi these days.

All i all, this was much of what you would expect from this franchise...perhaps too much. I sincerely hope we don't get a Joanna Wick continuing this saga, but that it now can take a well deserved rest.",4
WinstonNoCGI,"First of all: Perhaps I should have watched the previous John Wick movies first in order to find a value in this movie's plot. Well, I didn't watch the prequels. So, perhaps I may be missing the true core value of this flick. Who knows ...

First, the plot summary: People are getting killed over and over and over again. That's it. End of story. Period.

Yet, for what cause do they fight? So, they just hate each other?? ... or love each other? Hundreds of them? And they all just die in seconds? Where did all these fighters get their training from? How did they all master such training if they all die on a fast lane in the end?

For John & friends it doesn't seem sufficient to just immobilize their enemies and continue to deal with another person. Oh no, way off the mark! They compulsively must return to every seriously wounded person and finish him/her off while already ""serving"" their next slaughter victim ...

Actually, while watching the movie I couldn't fail to get the impression that I was barely audiencing a rendition of some gamer who is playing a first person shooter computer game. The plot didn't have any deeper sense than that at all. No goal to achieve other than killing everybody until John & friends were the last men standing. During the fight scenes I was from time to time looking out for a game score in the corners of the screen.

Considering the stunts: The flick was advertised for its great fight scenes. So, well - I came expecting ... great fight scenes. But what did I get: CGI fights. Animated computer characters fighting animated computer characters. How much more boredom can be portrayed than barely watching computer characters fight each other.

Anyone glorifying the fight seens here in his/her reviews: So, you don't recognize a plain CGI rendering when you're watching it? Really?? - So, you didn't recognize all the unnatural character movements during fights or shootings? You didn't recognize or realize that the whole Place Charles de Gaulle scene was a computer animation with no man nor dog nor any car being recorded in reality? You plainly have been watching a bloody computer rendering on a large screen and failed to recognize??

These unnatural rubber toy, superball movements of the CGI characters during fight scenes kept me wondering if I had accidentally visited one of those dreadful poorly computer animated Marvel flicks.

Well, I guess it should be clear to everyone that no-one ... I repeat: NO-ONE by far could have survived any of these fight scenes. John Wick would have died multiple times: Fully hit by a car, but suffering no harm, huh? Falling down the stairs hundreds of meters, but he's fine and immediately continuing to fight. Or he's crashing into another car unbelted. The car is broken, yet John is left uninjured - yeah, sure ...

Honestly, I'm a person who wants to believe. Yet, there is a limit that's being reached when it comes to a certain degree of incredibility. Now, that limit of credibility has by far been exceeded by this flick.

Next, the musical score was a true disappointment. It didn't convey any emotion. It just played some metal licks, being strung together, or boring loops that have been played.

By the way: What sense does it make for this decade's professional radio station to play vinyl records or multi-track tapes from a tape recorder?

Last but not least: Character depictions were shallow. Since the musical score failed to support the characters, I failed to feel for any of them. ... One of John's friends died? Well, OK, fine. Next.

For me, this movie was a true disappointment.",2
varun-25071997,"John Wick 4 is not just the best film of the franchise but undeniably one of the greatest action films of all time. Despite it's lengthy runtime being felt at points, the action set pieces out do each other with every passing minute. We might have witnessed the greatest action scenes in film history.

Keanu Reeves has once again proven why he is up there with Tom Cruise as one of the greatest actors in the action genre. With each decade he continues to deliver and doesn't seem to slow down. The use of music in the movie is second to none. The beauty of John Wick is that it's unapologetically maximalist and unlike the MCU films which is scared to take itself seriously, John Wick 4 believes it's hype.

It will be criminal to deny this movie accolades for cinematography, editing and sound. Chad gives us a fitting conclusion for the John Wick saga. The fight scene in Osaka never gets tiring and raises the stake by every kill, which is metamorphic to the entire franchise.",8
albertosampaio-24206,"Just a lame action movie. Poor fight choreography and very ridiculous excess of villains at the scenes. Also, too many scenes being repeated over and over again, like be falling down the stairs or the running overs, or the nunchakus scenes. I also found the blind guy being so bad ass as being absolutely ridiculous too. I don't remember John Wick 1 and 2 as this very exaggerated and uncommitted to the truth action movie as this one is. I'm surprised that this movie is actually rated in IMDb with an eight.

The only things that I liked was the 2D-like shooting scene and the final duel ending. I sincerely hope that there's no John Wick movies anymore.",1
syutaka-76373,"John Wick becomes a soulless killer in this movie in a bad way. He already lost his purpose to live, but selfishly continuously caused a lot of trouble with his friends.

There are two big stupid plots.

First is why did he hide in Osaka hotel and make his Japanese friend in danger? There is no necessity of john taking that move, I know it's just for the sake of filming Japanese assassin scenes, but that makes John stupid and selfish.

And the second is a duel system. Out of blue Winston told that...Why no one told John about this system in movie 3...

Fighting scenes are too long and dull.

The black guy with a dog is a unnecessary character.

I miss beauty in simplicity in the first movie...",3
thatchaz,"Oh dear. This was truly awful. I loved the first three but Keanu is laughably atrocious whenever he opens his mouth in this one.

Cane had me laughing until I cried. I could just see the Family Guy parody that will surely be in the works soon!

Nothing made sense.

Such a shame, they threw a load of money at this and forgot all about the plot and characters.

The fight scenes were fantastic, especially the later scenes in Paris, but the heart of what made the first John Wick a surprise hit was missing.

The dog. The wife. It's all long forgotten at this point, and a 5 second flashback doesn't help that.

By the end I didn't care what happened, I just wanted the three hours to be up so I could leave the cinema!",3
Olivier_Lacelle,"Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe It was a mistake to bingewatch the three previous movies beforhand. But my two friends and myself are unanimous after watching the movie durong a premiere : it was BAD. I mean, REALLY BAD.

SPOILERS ALERT.

Where do I begin. The movie starts with a plan in a dark room with Keanu hitting some board to train himself and Morpheus, euh I mean Laurence Fishburne's Hobo King character telling him it's time. And then... we almost didn't see him for the rest of the movie. It doesn't make any sense since he was the main ally John Wick could count on at the end of the third movie. In fact, nothing makes sense in this movie afterwards !

Right after, he's teleported in the desert, chasing guys on horse, and he kills the wiseman just like that. Why ? There are so many characters there that doesn't have any purpose in the story, like the mercenary and his dog. Same for the Father and his daughter in Japan. John Wick travels all over the world but we don't even know why.

The main antagonist... oh my god. Take all the clich√©s you can find on the french aristocracy and put it in one guy, and you got this movie's villain. Onlike any other villain of the franchise, he's not even scared a little bit of John Wick, not until the very end... when he choses a blind guy to do a pistol dual with John. Yeah right !

Almost everything that made the previous movies so good is thrown away : the lights and colors, the rythm, the scared villains, the original choregraphies of the fights, etc. Another element that is lacking : John Wick's pain. This time, he doesn't look tough and resilient, with sheer will and tenacity. He just look stupididly invincible and invulnerable. He can get it by a car 5 times, fall from 5 stories, or from 222 stairs... no problem at all ! He's not even slightly injured. It's just ridiculous !

At some point, people in the theater were laughing and it was clearly not supposed to. My friend fell asleep and I was looking at my watch. Oh and if you know Paris, you realize the traject he follows is absurd.

I don't know if it's a coincidence but it seems that they changed the scenarists for this last installment. I've also read that the original version before cut had a near 4 hour lenght. Maybe we got here a part of the explanation.... sorry Keanu.",5
sarathcnathan,"It's top notch action sequences. Will easily watch 3,4 times in iMAX. Beyond action the story was touching with dark comedies. It's one of my top 10 favorite movie. Don Y, was classy with many one word, one line jokes. You got Knief, swords, pistols, lots of pistols, tons of pistols, automatic riffle, cars, motor bikes, horse and the best and my favorite was nunchuks. Keanu made it all look real. Can see the level effort he put on the stunt sequence. Came angle from the roof POV was awesome. Fight in steps was mind blowing. Climax was like cherry on top. Not the end end, the one before. Trying to be mindful with no spoilers. Enjoy the movie in iMAX people.",10
flicklover,"I have to say that the only John Wick film that I've really liked before this one is the original. The two sequels that followed we're good but 8 wasn't as impressed as I was with the first one. Also, the 3rd one felt to bloated. It was all over the place.

So what about John Wick 4? It is no doubt the best since the original. I would say even better. When I saw the long runtime u thought it would be too long and dragged out but what Keanu Reeves and durector Chad Staheski have put together one of the most exciting action movies to come out in a very long time. They went for broke here. As far as story, that has never been the strong suit of this franchise anyway but again John Wick wants his freedom from The High Table and everyone is out to stop him. What makes this film so enjoyable is how comfortable Keanu Reeves is in the role and ll8ndont know how much of the stunt work he actually died but he goes all out here. The fight and gun choreography is on a level that is now the new standard. These days action films are so full 9f CGI that they feel.like animation really. I'm sure that this film has CGI in many spots but there is a great amount of terrific stunt work done here. The action is fast, and somewhat exhausting at times but done in a way that has you glued to the screen!!!

Best action film in a long time!

Grade: A-",10
mccraryjennifer,"The John Wick movies are not traditionally ""good"". They don't have much of a plot, and the acting isn't great...but it doesn't have to be, because they have AMAZING action sequences. The first half of John Wick 4 is no exception. In fact, it's a Master's Class in fight scene choreography, that manages to be both clever, and occasionally humorous, in its brutality. I particularly appreciated their recognition of nun chucks as the blunt instruments they are. With the physics involved it takes 0 training to use them effectively (notice I didn't say well)- after all, they are illegal in the US for a reason. Any moron can generate tremendous force with two sticks and a string, and will be just fine as long as they don't miss. John Wick knows what to do when he misses, but he mostly just swings the crap out of them...and it's glorious.

Then they jumped the shark. Potential spoilers beyond this point.

Where they started to lose me was with a sweaty mobster with a bullet in his butt moving like an uninjured Olympic martial artist. Wick surviving a fall that at the very least should have been life altering further chipped away at my suspension of disbelief...especially since a similar fall ultimately killed the sweaty mobster with the inhaler.

But where they really lost me, was the dog. I didn't want the dog to die. I never want the dog to die. But if you hit a dog with a car hard enough to dent it, it's not going to pop back up like nothing happened, in all its obviously CGI glory...and that removed all the tension. If the dog can't die, neither can the important humans. If the important humans can't die, there are no stakes. If there are no stakes, there is no excitement...and it's boring. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you turn what started off as one of the best action franchises in recent years into The Three Stooges. The whole thing just dissolved into a slapstick mess that bored me and literally put my husband to sleep.

I will still watch anything Kenau Reeves does.",3
josephmpapp,"It was well shot and Choreographed. Action was fine... and then it got tiresome... and then it got boring and repetitive.

Basically, you're just checking your watch to realize there's still an hour of this movie left. While fans eat this up, passive viewers are checking out. There was do much time that could have been edited out, but the director had to make sure every step was on camera. Literally, there are moments where you have nothing of value put on screen for no necessary reason. Do we seriously need to see him walk the entire distance to the candles, light a candle, and walk all the way to his seat? Do we need the extra hour of random assassins just to pretend he'll be stopped?

You gotta be crazy to call this the best action film. It's okay, but too self indulgent and overlong to watch again. Can directors please stop making movies over 2.5 hrs long?

Spoilers:

John wick kills hundreds, gets to a duel, gets mortally wounded, and kills the big bad. He wins everything, and dues on steps. Every action scene is him turning corners. Shooting guys, stabbing those close to him, reloading, and doing it again.

If this sounds familiar, it's because it's the same as the last three movies sans the loss of his dog in the first (the only good one).",5
mariaananth,"I don't even know where to start; this film is a true masterpiece. The past three installments in the series were extremely fantastic and were close to perfection, but chapter 4 is by far the finest. It brought this series to realms I never ever imagined were possible.

I was very impressed by Donnie Yen and Shamier Anderson's performances. They are excellent performers who played their parts almost perfectly. It truly impresses me that Keanu Reeves performs all of his stunt work; he is undoubtedly one of the finest performers of his time. Keanu Reeves was terrific as usual, taking this series to heights I didn't even think were possible. The battle sequences, choreography, and stunts were all top-notch. Undoubtedly, this series is the.

I really appreciate how they incorporated aspects from classic action movies into the plot. I must also honour Chad Stahelski, who gave us a fantastic conclusion to this wildly popular franchise. Another person I can't forget is Lance Reddick, who gave a magnificent performance in the series despite though he only had a little role. May his soul rest in peace.",10
ccastillo-78911,"Unrealistic ridiculous fight scenes with Kevlar suits have ruined the last two installments of what could have been a great film series. The elongated fight scenes have been hard to bear. The staircase sequence was the icing on the cake for over the top hilarious overdone nonsense. Everyone and anyone sitting in the movie theater was shouting ""c'mon"" on almost every overdone scene. If they had just stuck to a more believable approach this movie would have been an hour shorter and a lot more bearable to say the least. I left the movie ready wondering why the director(s) didn't see the flaws in the 3rd installment with the cartoonist fight scenes and go back to the drawing board. Definitely reminded me of a Michael Bay film smh.",6
popyoshi-36312,"Phenomenal. The action is as gritty and phenomenal as the past 3 films, there's still some of the campiness and unreleastic bits of action like 2 & 3 but the realism is still phenomenal, the story is much better than 2 & 3 it introduces 2 very interesting new characters and has such amazing world building added in that adds to the franchise and overall the story finally gives John wick actual reasons to fight once again. The movie is amazing I personally found some scenes dragged on a slight ammount but it's a very minor issue because of how good the story is and action, 10/10 movie 100% recommend watch all the John wick films.",10
singakd,"John Wick 1 was love at first viewing and the saga continues! JW4 has all that and more you expect from Keanu-Chad duo. It has the growth of our main lead, much to crave for action sequences, brotherhood element at its finest and a deserving end. I for once agree with the commiserating end but I secretly greed for more JW and why not when there are other less deserving sequels from the likes of FandF, Transformers out there. It was a very heartwarming to see they stayed true to the original element and exceeded our expectations with the choreography and assasin universe. I can clearly see how JW world has set the ripples in all other movies that are now adapting proper action choreography.",10
rasmusjonsson-73138,"To begin on a good note I honestly do enjoy the world they've created here. Learning about various factions and whatnot and how the entire system functions is honestly interesting.

However I feel that's where the good stuff both begins and ends.

The quality of the action in these movies bounces between good choreography, bad choreography and just the action being over the top.

Bad choreography includes people with guns running into melee instead of them just being smart and using the fact that they have guns. There's a looooot of that to fill the runtime, a looooot of really stupid bad guys.

Over the top stuff includes a blind dude fighting like he was Daredevil.

And now and then you're left with some good scenes.

These movies are fine but completely overhyped. Remember that this entire story exists only because the greatest assassin in the world got defeated by a couple of random goons followed by them killing his dog.",5
Kryolux,"Just watched John Wick: Chapter 4 online, by finding a free site that pirated the film. Yeah, it had French subtitles and was interrupted a few times with ads for a lottery in India. But I was able to speed up the dull parts, slow down and replay the action scenes. The only thing I couldn't see was a special scene after the credits, as this version ended just before the credits began.

If you saw the previous three chapters, you can appreciate that they upped the choreographic level of the fight scenes; the death total easily pushes into the hundreds. Some of it seems gratuitous (OK, it's almost all gratuitous) but it sets a cinematic bar for this kind of lethal action that will likely never be matched.

Some of the locations (Osaka, Berlin, Paris) seem to have been picked solely for their aesthetics, as in the previous film that took the action out of New York. How this guy gets to instantly zip around the world without being noticed (except by one or two trackers who seem to get to where he winds up even before he does) is almost as mystifying as how he manages to fall multiple times from several stories up, or get hit by cars multiple times, or tumble down dozens of Parisian steps leading to Sacre Couer de Montmartre Church more than once (why did I suddenly think of Laurel & Hardy's classic ""The Music Box"" -- the one with the piano repeatedly going up and down the long stairs -- while watching this?) and nobody seems smart enough to fire at him from a safe distance while behind a safe barrier. Simple rule... if you get within ten feet of Wick, you are dead. Hey, remember that he can kill with a pencil? Here he attacks a guy with a playing card! Oh, and he gets to use nunchucks for the first time. Lots of bodies breaking through glass, but going through it never seems to cause any cuts.

It is still implausible that so many supposed professional hit men are so easily dispatched and seem unable to get even one good head shot in out of the hundreds of tries.

I won't give away the assumed ending, which is both logical and anti-climactic, yet since I didn't see the post-credits scene, I have to wonder if it's a ruse to allow for more of the franchise, seeing as how each film makes more money than the one before it. With this film, the longest of the four, being nearly three hours long, I can only imagine that any fifth film will require bladders of titanium and include a body count in the thousands.

Reeves has even fewer lines here than in any of the previous shorter films, mostly just saying ""Yeah"" a lot. He and most of the others talk in epigrams and fortune-cookie-style one-liners meant to sound deep, but usually just come across as goofy or puzzling.

The tracker known as Mr. Nobody has a dog trained to attack on command, similar (almost identical) to Halle Berry's dogs in Chapter 3. When he says ""Nuts"" the dog goes for, well, you can guess where. At least five times. When Wick prevents the dog from getting shot (we know how important dogs are to the franchise) Mr. Nobody rethinks his entire raison. Seems his dog's life was worth more than 40 million dollars. But then, killing a pup is the original sin that started this entire franchise!

Some parts are better than the whole. Some parts make little or no sense. Not a single cop is ever seen no matter how much violence ensues; indeed, in several places, while guns are blazing and swords are swinging, the civilians just act as if nothing is happening, and make no attempt to flee. So much is a cross between cartoonish -- several Wiley-Coyote-style falls, minus the anvil, but still no apparent injuries -- and video game choreography (there's even a god's-eye-view tracking shot that clearly was lifted from an actual video game).

I'm told that the classic 1979 New York action film ""The Warriors"" was the template for this film, with Wick substituting for an entire NYC gang trying to make it home. In an outright theft, they even have a black female DJ's closeup mouth to the mic smugly following Wick's trip across the city, exactly as in the earlier film (Lynne Thigpen did it better; oh, those lips!).

If you've seen the previous three films, and appreciate what was done superlatively, and overlooked the implausibles and recycled tropes, I guess you will have to see Chapter 4 for whatever supposed closure it may or may not offer. When someone catches the post-credits scene, please let me know what was in it, as I'm pretty sure it's the key to how Chapter 5 begins.

Yeah... a franchise film that debuts at $72 million (almost double the last bounty on Wick's life), the best start of the whole series, isn't going to toss away the opportunity to rake in even more. After all, the High Table hasn't been defeated, the New York Continental has to be rebuilt, and Laurence Fishburne needs more scenery to chew up. Expect gratuitous trips to London, Rome, and Istanbul.",N/A
dombernetti,This movie met every one of my expectations! It delivered with the great action of a typical John Wick action but also had other compelling story lines and the one liners you would expect. The actions scenes are top notch but they always have an undertone of rules and respect that makes it really enjoyable. The lighting was great and even with endless action they still made you really enjoy the characters. The storyline was simple and straight forward but keeps you engaged through out the whole movie. The ending was unpredictable which i really appreciated and I felt keeps me excited. It was not meant to be repetitive and ruin the franchise. It told a story and stuck to the code of the movie. This movie knows exactly what it is and did it 10 out of 10. Amazing.,10
pappywatts,"Hmmm. Difficult to sum up No 4 as clouded by the previous three which were superlative, is this really a modern western in disguise?. It has all the ingredients for conflict,redemption,revenge,resolution,however the new characters, with classic kung fu,versus the European heavies in tight shiny suits don't get you hating the bad guys, just another line of targets to clear.

The great thing about the previous productions is the viewer is invested in the main characters we're familiar with, and what happened to Wick's dog? Just a series of set pieces knitted together indoors and outside in different cities, there is no subtlety, knock 'em down ! Next !

There is a sequence where viewed from above third person view ,emulating a PC game, a satire on the gaming generation? Also some of the post release interviews there is a score card on how many times a stunt double had been killed.

The redeeming part of the film is Wick's backstory and origin family.

It is a long film two hours and forty minutes, probably better to stream and pause occasionally, to rest from violence overload.",8
MovieWarfare,"John Wick is one of the best action franchises in modern cinema. When John Wick first came out in 2014, it was one of the most surprising yet most enjoyable experiences I had. What is even more amazing is that the 2 sequels it got were also amazing! We are now on the 4th entry and the question is if it continues to maintain the quality it has so far.

Let's get the obvious out of the way, the action scenes are still absolutely amazing! One thing each entry in this franchise continues to do is to make the action bigger and crazier than the last. There are so many incredible actions set pieces with a roughly 30-minute action scene in Osaka with bows and swords, a stunning sequence in Paris with cars and traffic, a Hotline Miami style action sequence with overhead shots, and one of the best action sequences ever involving stairs. I give every single praise to the stunt people who worked on this as they take some very painful falls in this film. This entry is also the best-looking one in the franchise. The set design and cinematography are phenomenal. John Wick killing people has never looked as beautiful as it does here.

Keanu continues to be awesome as John Wick by still doing the action choreography at the age of 57. We get to see him fight with nunchucks and shoot goons while driving a car. Ian McShane, Lance Reddick (R. I. P) and Laurence Fishburne return as Winston, Charon and the Bowery King respectively. They're all still great but have a smaller role this time. There are many new supporting characters are great as well. Donnie Yen joins the franchise as Caine, a blind assassin, who is an old friend but now foe. Donnie Yen always gives his A-game and here is no exception with how he does action as a blind character makes him interesting to watch. Hiroyuki Sanada is Koji who is the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel who is just a badass and cool guy, Rina Sawayama makes her acting debut as Akira and she does a good job in her small role with some good action as well. Shamier Anderson plays an assassin who tracks John Wick and he also does some great action. What they do with his character is interesting but the best thing is that he has a dog which makes him 100% better. Scott Adkins plays Kilia and he does a good job as a minor antagonist. The main antagonist, Marquis Vincent, is played by Bill Skarsgard and he does a great job of being hateable.

What Chapter 4 has over Chapters 2 and 3 is more emotional elements to the story. John Wick is deservingly angry after 3 but you also get to see him contemplate more about when this bloodshed will end. You see him question a lot of what he is doing and whether these conflicts that are bringing his friends into are worth it. Additionally, his relationship with Caine (Donnie Yen) adds some weight to the conflict by making close friends fight each other. The stakes in this film feel bigger as well. Some people complain about the 2-hour 45-minute runtime but the pacing never felt bad and the quieter moments are enjoyable too. If I had to give a negative then the only one, I can think of is the post-credit scene which dampens the ending a little bit.

Overall, what an outstanding film! It's insane to think that even on its 4th entry, this film continues to be entertaining and somehow still amazing! Director Chad Stahelski has made an extraordinary franchise and shows everyone in Hollywood, how to make an action movie. With the inclusion of a post-credit scene, I wonder if the plan is to make a new cinematic universe which worries me a bit. There are a lot of potential spinoff ideas such as a Caine (Donnie Yen) spinoff or a Tracker spinoff (Shamier Anderson) or a spinoff with the John Wick 3 character Sofia (Halle Berry). Whatever they do, if it is the same quality as the John Wick movies, then I will be first in line to watch.",10
CinemaSerf,"Now this is an whole lot better than ""John Wick - Paracetamol"" (2019) but it is still not very good. This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful ""Marquis"" (Bill Skarsg√•rd), who has managed to get those at the ""High Table"" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting ""Winston"" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the ""Marquis"" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for ""Wick"", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game. Indeed, for almost all of the action sequences here the whole point seems to be: kill as many of the useless, hapless - but heavily armed - enemy as you can whilst perhaps bleeding a little from the mouth now and again. Use your finely tailored Kevlar suit to deflect bullets, blades, flames - just about everything as you, inevitably, survive against constantly insurmountable odds for well over 2¬Ω hours before a denouement that is, admittedly, quite quirky. That involves a sort of Sacre-Coeur version of snakes and ladders but again, luckily, against innumerable would-be assassins who couldn't hit a barn door with an Howitzer at point blank range. Skarsg√•rd isn't remotely menacing - like a poor ""James Bond"" villain in a perfectly measured suit, Laurence Fishburne features only sparingly and the whole thing has as much jeopardy as the 'Wizard of Oz"" (1939). Reeves does not act here, he performs - and the profusion of CGI, the complete lack of any police or domestic military in Japan, Paris or New York to address the increasingly chaotic and damaging carnage being caused in these locations all just wanted me to start shouting ""thwack"" and ""pow"" at the screen. There is a delightful twist at the end, but it's a very long time in the coming and to be perfectly honest, I was just a bit bored. I've never really been in love with this franchise, it's all too repetitive and predictable - and sadly, this is just the same.",6
geislekm,"If you love to watch hundreds of bad guys get killed, then the John Wick series is the one to watch, but you need to leave your sense of reality outside and prepare to devote all your energy to maintaining your suspension of disbelief.

The most challenging obstacle I encountered was the way they exhibited Kevlar suits. Apparently the director would like you to belief that if you hold up a icee of Kevlar fabric then bullets... I dunno... bounce off?

That's not how Kevlar works, people. The Kevlar might stop the bullet from penetrating, but it does nothing to mitigate the kinetic energy of the bullet.

I watched a news reporter ""demonstrate"" his Kevlar vest, as he had a fellow employee literally shot him with a low caliber bullet from close range. The vest did stop the bullet, but the impact knocked him on his back and broke two ribs.

You can hold up your Kevlar jacket lapel and the the bullet's energy will rip it out of your hand and, best case scenario, break half the bones in your face.

Then there is the fact that all those trained killers seem unable to hit anything vital, despite the two or three thousand rounds fired. They must all be retired Galactic Stormtroopers.

Then there's this dog that keeps killing assassins, but apparently only one of them ever thought about shooting the dog. Who knew that hired assassins were also animal lovers?

If you can make it through the movie without shouting out ""Oh come on!"", then you will enjoy it. If not, skip it and sneak into a different theater.",7
cruise01,"5 out of 5 stars.

John Wick Chapter 4 is an awesome neo noir action thriller film that gets better in each sequel. The film continues after the last. John Wick (Keanu Reeves) trying to go after the high table after what happened to the previous film. This sequel is bigger, epic, and action sequences are over the top exciting.

The films script and story does have a lot of world building with new characters. Like Caine (Donnie Yen), Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada), Tracker (Shamier Anderson), Akira (Rina Sawayama), and villain Marquis (Bill Skarsgard). All these characters have a moment to shine. It does provide more interest to the story.

The film action sequences are exciting and never slows down. It gets wild and edge of your seat. Director does a great job in delivering an action film that is creative and entertains.

The cast ensemble is great. The music score is awesome. It is one long film but it never slows down and feels fast paced. I am excited to see more sequels. This film does have a great conclusion to the series without giving away spoilers. It tied everything down. But it is one franchise that should keep going. Overall, it is one of the best films this year. There is one post credit scene that is worth checking out.",10
wolfeE-leet,"I didn't see any other John Wick films before seeing this one and had no expectations beyond a gun fight movie starring Reeves.

What transpired was an unnecessarily long movie with a script that felt stretched as far as it could go. The first half of the film felt like a serious of contrived action scenes. The Japanese segment droned on for at least twenty minutes just for Wick's old friend to be unnecessarily killed for dramatic effect.

Then when the viewer is about to abandon all hope of any central storyline, it's revealed Wick can win his freedom by challenging Illuminati guy to a duel. Fair enough. What followed was another 30 minutes of fight scenes just for our guy to technically qualify for the duel.

In the end Wick wins his freedom but he's shot up and presumably dies thereby invalidating the characters whole motivation during the whole film. If death was an accepting ending for him why didn't he just kill himself?

Keanu Reeves looks old, tired, and depressed throughout much of this film. He talks slow and at times I wonder if he has early dementia. He's definitely not in his prime anymore and it shows. I'm of the opinion that action stars out of their prime should hang up the gloves and avoid intense action roles. They embarass themselves by providing a less impactful performance than what they were previously capable of.

My favorite thing about this movie was the avoidance of shaky-cam. All the action scenes use steady-cam shots which allow the viewer to fully take in and understand the scene. While I didn't like the movie much, I am grateful to have supported (with my money) the continued use of steady-camera.",6
mrglenngrant,"I had such high hopes for this after re-watching the highly entertaining first three movies. They were always a little bit silly but I always felt there was some reality to hang onto amongst the insane action: people died after getting shot; violence was for the most part underground; there was no superhuman element; etc. That all changed in this movie.

There was nothing wrong with the story at all - it could have made a really great film ... but there was so much that took me completely out of the movie.

It's never explained how a blind guy can go all Daredevil and be able to fight the way he does and manage to hit Wick 3 times (once from 30 paces!) in their duel. (And why didn't John Wick just step to the side a bit?) I found myself trying to pretend he wasn't a blind dude throughout. That helped a wee bit.

The all out shooting and action takes place in the very centre of a very well populated (and well policed!) Paris ... yet no authorities turn up at all? Anywhere?

Where are all the people?!? How do they manage to get some of the busiest tourist spots in Paris to themselves to have a grand meeting in front of the Eiffel Tower and a duel in front of the Sacre Coeur? I've been to these places and they're not quiet...!

How does Wick survive multiple multi-story falls that would kill ... or at least severely injure someone ... and then just get up and run away? But one wee bullet in the tummy finishes him off? After all this? Please.

It was nice to see a kinda LOST reunion happening ... with Mr Abadon, Mr Friendly and Dogan all in this film.

If this is the direction that the franchise was going then I'm kindof glad it's the last one. Maybe they pulled out all the stops knowing that ... but they pulled them out way too far.

Board,"At the time of writing, 8th of April 2023, ""John Wick 4"" has an average score of 8.3 on Imdb and is #155 on their top 250.

When me and two others decided to go to the cinema to watch it, it was 8.4 and #130, so it has slumped a bit, and deservedly so I would say.

When we came out of the cinema my friend, who's a bigger fan of the series than I am, said, bewildered, that he didn't understand why this movie was supposed to be so much better than the first three.

That's how I felt as well. It was the same basic plot line as the first three: Without giving away more than just the very beginning of number 4, number 3 ends with John Wick going on the run. Then number 4 starts with John Wick killing The Elder in Morocco.

Then, surprise, surprise, the high table wants him dead yet again - just like in the earlier movies. Then a lot of fighting ensues - just like in the earlier movies. Then John Wick defeats them all without even getting wounded - just like in the earlier movies.

""Chapter 4"" is pretty much just like the other movies: A very basic plot line and a lot of fighting. They've already made three movies like that, so why do we need another? I found ""Chapter 3"" to be the weakest in the series. It was overly long and just a lot of boring, long fights without much plot. At least ""Chapter 4"" is slightly better than ""Chapter 3"", but not by much. Granted, ""Chapter 4"" might be the best film in the series, but number 1 and 2 are pretty much just as good. I did also feel that ""Chapter 4"" didn't feel as long or drawn out as ""Chapter 3"", despite actually being longer, so I have to give them credit for that.

Nevertheless, the film was all in all pretty much a throwaway, unless you think watching three hours of fight scenes is the epitome of cinema.

One particular aspect needs special mention though, which is Keanu Reeves' acting: I haven't watched many of his films, which hasn't been a conscious choice, but he's sometimes mentioned as one of those somewhat typical Hollywood cases: Good-looking person who can't act.

""Chapter 4"" is quite possibly the worst acting I've seen from him. Keanu didn't say much in this movie, and almost every time he did, I almost started laughing, as his lines were just delivered in a ridiculously poor manner, especially if he was in a gruelling situation.

Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne were great, as always, but Keanu Reeves was terrible. Luckily, he mostly fought and walked rather than talked.",6
darktrick,"It may seem odd to call a movie that has 7-10 minute gunfights, one after the other, boring, but it was absolutely so. After the second or third or fourth time filming the same action scene in a different location just to add to the runtime, most people should be irritated they weren't given anything unique and were cheated out of 3 hours of a day.

I love action films and I have a rather unhealthy ability to suspend disbelief, but this movie, more than maybe any other I have seen, requires me to forget all common sense and everything I know about the character from the first couple films. If you want to watch someone impervious to damage (""god mode"") and killing his way through enemies who are lined up neatly for slaughter, this is the movie for you. If you want to watch a movie with anything resembling a consistent plot, virtually any dialogue and even the slightest bit of suspense that he may be in peril, watch a different movie.",4
shanzab,"John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.",10
shaikhirshad-41223,"What a movie. One of the best action movie I've ever witnessed. First n all the main credit goes to the director of this film CHAD STAHELSKI. From movie story, screenplay, action sequences, choreography and to present the world of John Wick and all the characters in one frame is not an easy job. The way this movie describes the action stunts and sequences is like never before seen. What a dedication to make this real. No one can perform JOHN WICK'S character better than KEANU REEVES. He's the soul of the film and the way he has given the outstanding performances in every chapter is totally worth it. From Chp 1 to Chp 4 his journey is still the same and he hasn't age a bit. But what a way to end his journey and the saga completely satisfied. The way director has build the world of john wick is just phenomenal. Can't wait for Ballerina. Don't listen to anyone just go and experience the Unimaginable Action sequences it'll blow your mind specially last 40 mins is a treat. Even if you had never seen last 3 chp still go and enjoy the action sequences. This movie is exciting as well as emotional for John Wick fans because the Saga is come to an end. The one and only "" BABA YAGA """,9
christiirp,"Unfortunately this was one of those very rare movie times when I couldn't wait for it to end. The unrealism of this movie has been raised to the extreme heights, making it torturing to watch and laughable just how far from any reality many scenes are and most background just doesn't make any realistic sense.

Action packed, immersively cinematographic, drawn-out fighting that is out of any realism for almost 3 hours with no palpable and enjoyable storyline or depth, sometimes even horrible acting - if that is your cup of tea, you will absolutely love and enjoy the movie. Otherwise you will be highly disappointed.",3
jasonlesmana,"This film is the fourth film from Franchise John Wick and has the longest time of about 169 minutes. The film was directed by the same person and the same main actor namely Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves, as well as newcomers such as Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Sanada, Lance Reddick, Ian Winston, Rina Sawayama, Scott Adkins and many more. This film tells John Wick who wants to be free from high tables and look for ways to be free from the ex communicado and the only way to fight the high table itself

Cons: -Fight Scene that repetitive from the previous film uses the same method and there are some scenes using the same style in fighting it

Pros:

-Sound that is very supportive of the Cons earlier, the fight scene, every background of the sound is so beautiful and very suitable for fighting or dialogue.

-Cematography is very beautiful like I play video games. Image drawing in this film is really next level of all other Hollywood action films

-Ating Donnie Yen here is super cool and stealing the show besides that Keanu Reeves also looks more brutal and crazy as Rina Sawayama whose acting is so cool

-Storyline is super beautiful and maybe one of the best storyline for the best franchise movie in the action film is very beautiful and great

-World Building The broad makes this film can explore this franchise further

-Artistik Fight and Color Grading which is very beautiful makes this film much better than the previous film that distinguishes here the choreographer has a fighting style and art that is really strong so it is different from other action films

Verdict

This film is the greatest film John Wick and even the best action in 2023. This film has all the existing aspects ranging from great action sequences, and from the beginning it is already tense which makes this film top notch and help from the sound, editing, cinematography, acting and manuscripts that make this film is a film that is suitable to be watched for lovers Action film and maybe this is the most beautiful work for an action franchise film in the world. (P. S: There is 1 Post Credit Scene that is still connected to the world of John Wick) üòä

nishitpatel-92696,"I had some doubt on how they're gonna do better than chapter 3. Well they've done better than previous movies. Pure two and half hours of action entertainment. Cinematography was top level, hats off to Keanu reeves and other people associated with stunt. Something like this will never be ever filmed. This film will set example for current and upcoming generation like Terminator 2 and Die hard was to us. I've seen so many classic and critically acclaimed films from all over world. This is what we needed. Totally worth my time and scene points. Must be watched on screen as much big as possible..",10
Ammarrshaikhh,"By far one of the best John Wick movies I've seen. If I may say, one of the best action movies I've ever seen even. The way he performs while using a gun just majestic. The way he tackles and takes an enemy down so aggressively but also with thought. The driving skills he's got with such precise kills in taking his enemy down just flawless. The movie consists of perfect story to action ratio with just perfect timing and execution between the both!

Reminded me of the old John Wick movies, but with a touch of spice which brought this to a perfect ending possibly. May just be the end but was a perfect end.",10
simplegamenews,"I walked out of theater for a film with so many hype and so many fake fans they know john wick if your happy with the ending fine with him dying your not a real fan unless you thinke he survived.

John Wick the man the myth the legend dies from a gunshot wound exactly where the doctor in 3rd got shot. Rambo got shot in the same shoulder he surivived the doctor survived. Not John Wick hereis the thing about action movie hero they are not supposed to die they are supposed to live. John Wick he died for nothing he dident take down the hightable his friend Donnie Yen probaly going to kill the friend he sacraficed his life for. Johns life is for nothing who did he save the trailers made us think he will take down the high table we could have had endgame moment where thousands of assasins fighting armys of high table forces. They killed of Charon which is bad because his death was for nothing. End of the day we havent even seen who is the true head of the High Table we got another villian like the ajudicator whose roles mean nothing. Not just the terrible ending the action is rushed. One and two the action was more slower and more focused. They are doing these fast shots if they making a pg 13 movie. Donnie Yen is not utilaized he is know for hand to hand not a gun and knife. 5 was supposed to be filmed at the same time as 4 canceled that plan because of covid are you telling me John true bad guy is covid 19. The thing I am worried about is that they will replace Joh n Wick with Ana De Armas or the new girl Akira if thats the case why is everything killing of male charachters with female nobody wants a MSHEU. This can be fixed bring Keanu Reeves back I will give this a 6 out of 10 do not come with the excuses he is old Tom Cruise is older and he going to keep doing stunts until he dies. This is not how a man , myth the legend is suppoded to die he is Baba Yaga not some cry baby who died after a shot to the shoulder. Watch this at home if your desperate to see it.",1
rehamofficial,"John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.

While I have heard some say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best installment in the series I have to disagree, Nothing can top the original, in my opinion; however, Chapter 4 is a worthy installment for sure.

Will there be a Chapter 5 to the JohnWick saga? Remember, I said this was a Spoiler free review....

John Wick: Chapter 4 earns a 5 out of 5 star rating. It is worth seeing, and probably seeing again. I predict a significant box office gross for this one, and it is well deserved.",10
curunir-curunir-65,"Going into a John Wick movie you should probably be aware of what you are about to view and adapt your expectations accordingly. And honestly I really liked the previous movies, and I consider the first one to be one of the greatest action movies. But honestly, this 4th installment is just too much. I was at awe to see that it is now the most high-rated in the franchise and at the time that this review is written has an astonishing 8.2/10.

First, it seemed like the plot went missing. Again, this is a John Wick movie, you don't need something elaborate, but at least you should put a minimum effort. Friendships appeared out of nowhere, and the viewer is supposed to accept that these friendships are so strong that they could influence the events. Sub-plots related to these friendships were built and then left like nothing happened.

Second, one thing that this movie is praised is the almost non-stop action. To many people this seems like a positive. But honestly, the ""calm before the storm"" concept is something very useful to bring the viewer to the emotional status you want them, even in action movies. Here we didn't have this. Instead, we were bombarded with action scene after action scene, where John Wick should have died but didn't. And this fails to convey a fear. And after a while, all these action scenes appeared to be the same. There was a sequence towards the end which was different and more novel, which is appreciated. But apart from that everything was the same. Same moves, same choreography, people not dying when they should. John Wick is in constant danger and yet you don't fear for him for one second.

Third, contrary to popular belief, the movie was way too long (between 2.5-3 hours), and there were instances that the length could be reduced without losing too much, even within the non-stop action concept adopted by the movie. How many times do we need to climb the stairs in Montmartre?

This is not a bad action movie, but not as good as the 8.2 indicates.",6
heinyreimes,"I am a great fan of the first John Wick movie. A movie still grounded in reality where the protagonist gets knocked out by a baseball bat to the head and when he finds his car stolen and dog killed, he is out for justice.

He seems smart, capable, still a bit vulnerable and you feel the stakes he is fighting for and it's a bit like Taken on some strong Steroids.

----------------------------

This movie is nothing like that, besides al the awesome action (since awesome action it absolutely is). We are now in the MCU!

In this movie John Wick falls 222 stairs down and 30 seconds later he is up and running. He's being thrown 10 meters down and also here after 30 seconds he is up and running again. Even Deadpool might be thinking twice before he meets John Wick!

He also has to battle Dare Devil, but who decides to battle with swords and guns, but for some reason is not called Dare Devil. He knows exactly where the enemies are and what they are doing when the plots needs him to at other times he has to put in a bit more effort.

Also interesting how John Wick wastes a lot of bullets on 3 guys on horses in the desert running in a straight like, while in Paris he precisely headshots people in the middle of the air who are doing saltos after hit by cars. John Wick loves to play with your expectations in how capable you think him to be. One moment he kills 50 people in a minute, the next he has a hard time fighting the gold tooth german King Pin, even though he already hurt him in many ways(even shooting him up the @$$).

Also fun to see Morphius again, starting with a grandiose opening, firing things up (for no reason) and we expect a lot from him, since he wanted revenge of how he lost it all. To only show up close to the ending.

Also the psychotic party goers in Heaven and Hell in Germany is interesting to see. You see them sometimes looking at all the people being killed around them by guns, swords and axes that are flying around, to then just continue dancing again. Only after the boss has been killed, everyone is suddenly aware that they need to get out of there.

So if you just turn of your brain and look at the spectacle, you are in for a treat. Also the cinematography and music is really nice.",6
Mjnanakar,"A pointless film that did not address any particular issue, full of violent scenes and continuous shootings that were designed without a purpose, and it was not clear what the purpose of all this killing and war was being done, if If you want to just waste your time without paying attention to the passage of time, I suggest you to watch this movie.

However, it should also be noted that this example of movies is necessary for human life because you can watch it without thinking and just to get tired and give your thoughts and body a little rest, and you don't need anything from the movie. Guess, of course, the fact that the film does not pursue the right topic can be a weakness of its author.",1
tdsearles25,"I don't need to repeat all the positive points everyone else is already making. I want to highlight one awesome scene: the nunchuks!

Watching John Wick use the nunchucks as a skull bashing tool was the funnest scene in my opinion. Maybe not the flair or skill of Michelangelo but definitely the power and end result. I could go back and just watch that scene and be satisfied with it. Ninja Turtle fans everywhere appreciated it!

On to chapter 5? We all know he isn't dead. This isn't our first rodeo. Maybe in the next one he uses the Bo staff for a while, best impression of Donatello? Or maybe Raphs twin sai's? Weve already seen John Wick use swords. Would be a fun tribute to the TMNT fans.",8

moviehigh81,"Im going to keep it short and simple

I loved the previous John wick movies but this one was to much for me . I love all the action but the previous movies at least had somewhat of a decent storyline and dialogs to go along with it

But in this part 4 for me it looked more like was watching highlights of a new Xbox game .

The fight scenes are masterful specially with Donnie Yen on the CAST the action speed movement is just insane :) but the overall movie sucked the storyline should have been exploited more specially with a great cast like this movie has .

Long story short if you want a DOUBLE DOUBLE up john wick then you will love this movie.",6
michalandsberger,"Wow, just wow. Every action and marital art enthusiast must go to the cinema and buy a ticket to see this movie.

Wont go too much into detail of the plot, but just do us a favor and go see it in the cinema so studios will continue to make movies like these. Don't wait for it to come out on TV, don't stream it illegally, buy a ticket. Marvel and DC, write notes, this is how you make action.",10
kenstallings-65346,"There is no subtitle for chapter four, but if there was one, it would be ""Death Becomes Him."" Ultimately, the list of victims grow and along the way the allegories emerge clear.

From large groups of people remaining sublimely unaware of their surroundings, to a numbing list of people willing to sell their souls for money, the core message becomes quite clear.

There are things more important than money. When you sell your soul to other men for their money, you end up being trapped in a circle of evil. Life, such as it is, in such a situation, erodes ones humanity.

Throughout the series, there is a constant refrain, ""Rules. Without them we live with the animals."" Uttered first to imply a lowering of human standards when one breaks the rules, the series chugs along until the reality sets in firm in this episode coda.

If animals are the ones living free, and the humans are living as slaves by the rules, then the rules lower the humans. The rules represent a great tyranny and must be ended. Arise the agent of retribution, his name is John Wick!

Where the movie bogs down is in the volume of the retributions, which seem repetitive despite great efforts to find original ways to slaughter people. It's all for a movie's purpose, to further the lesson through metaphor that man is meant to live free!

In the end, whatever time one has to live free, it is worth the effort, given how living at the whims of others isn't living at all.",7
linus2804,"There is no action franchise more beloved than John Wick over the past decade.

John Wick 1 was a good balance between Action and Story. John Wick 2 was also a really good movie ( In my opinion ) After John Wick 3, it starts to lean more and more towards the action side and not focus so much on everything else.

John Wick 4 is a relatively long film. I think a total of 2 hours just fighting and shooting duels.

John Wick becomes a bit too much of a superhero in the sense that he lives being run down countless times, falls 20 meters onto the edge of the roof of a car. And the sequels he gets up and walks away.

What I liked about the old movies is that he was Badass but it was still realistic. He kills 150 people in John Wick 4. It's becoming too much of a superhero movie for my taste.

Another thing that I thought was mysteriously thought by the director. Is that when they shoot and throw axes at each other's heads in a nightclub, almost no one reacts to it.

And when they shoot with machine guns and other weapons in the middle of the road around The Arc de Triomphe are there no cars that speeds up or slows down. It is as if they are not there at all.

John Wick 4 is like riding a roller coaster. It's fun at first, but at some point, you just want to get off the ride.

I give it 5/10 due to the fact that it manages to make a decent story for it's 4th of a franchise.

And because I love Keanu.",5
akafilmandmedia-05787,"John Wick Chapter 4 is another great entry in the franchise, with a few hiccups here and there.

Naturally, the action sequences in this film were spectacular. It is still hard to believe that Keanu, at the age of 58, is still able to perform the stunts on show in this film. There is a great combo of hand to hand, gun combat, sword fighting and some insane action set pieces. Even though some of action does become a bit over the top and drags on too long, it still manages to blow you away.

The production design, cinematography and lighting continue to shine through. The night-life shots and sequences where the colours are accentuated continue to be a visual spectacle.

The film did slack on the narrative front. I felt that John Wick had no clear goal in this movie and was just going from objective to objective, defeating anyone who stood in his way.

Also, as much as I love Keanu, I really did not enjoy his acting. I understand Wick is supposed to be this reserved, almost emotion-less boogeyman, but Keanu just had too many cheesy one-liners. I struggled to take him seriously.

Bill Scarsgard as the Marquis (the main antagonist and villainous representative of the High Table) was okay. His character felt too similar to the The Ajudicator from the previous film.

I really enjoyed Donnie Yen's portrayal as the blind assassin, Caine. His swift, ruthless fighting style really stood out. I also liked the unique relationship he shared with Wick. I also cannot ignore the crazy German kingpin, Killa (Scott Adkins). He was a fun charismatic villian.

I am a big fan of John Wick universe world and the various characters that inhabit it. Therefore, I can say that despite its flaws, John Wick is still a fun and captivating experience which continues to push its action to the next level.

Definitely worth your time!",8
asokanta,"Before I watched John Wick 4, I watched other chapters of serie. My expectations were so high because I thought this movie was going to fill spaces in other chapters. All I had was getting more spaces in the story.

In the beginning, it was nonsense John teleporting to elder's desert without hearing or seeing a damn thing about it. Then he killed the elder and we went back to real life. What I don't understand is why they bothered showing us only the adjucator and the elder about high table in other chapter if they were gonna kill elder in 1 minute. This thing happened again in Osaka. Looks like John and manager know each other but we don't get a bit of storyline about them. They just talk 30 seconds then action starts.

The whole movie was nonsense/not close to reality to me. In other movies you can see the environment is a living thing, not a computer made visual. In like every outdoor part of this movie I was able to see scene isn't alive at all.

John was like Oblivion NPC in dialogues. He was only saying few words. I know it's his style of talk in this movie but I think they abused that thing.

All I feel about this movie is that they made it because it needed to be done. They didn't have intentions of improving an already cool serie.",3
chef-kyle,"For a conclusion to a franchise (at least the Wick story arc) you'd expect story. Each movie has gotten a little further away from telling an interesting story. I even enjoyed when they layered in more of this far-fetched stuff with the high-table & continental in 2 & 3. But, we still don't know much about this world, how it was created, or who is in charge. I thought this movie would do more with this secret government for criminals, but instead this movie made those aspects of the story pointless. So many elements from the past movies were just glazed over to essentially give this movie no story. No Elder, No Winston's betrayal, No past characters except Winston & The King, No Dog, No Wife. All of those things amounted to a few 1-liners in this movie. Instead they focused on the worst aspect of 3 and multiplied it with fights that last too long, and people that need to be shot 20 times. I personally preferred the realism and tactical focus to the action of 1 & 2.",6
darapjohnson,"First of all, I went into this 4th installment of John Wick with little expectations. I was thinking that 3 movies were perfect to end on. The perfect trilogy, why ruin it with even more installments? And I generally thought they would somehow mess up this movie?. I am now deeply ashamed that I thought that way, because this turned out to be much, much better than what I expected, hell even better than the previous installments (in my honest opinion).

This was the 2nd John Wick movie I saw at the cinema and once again, it was an amazing experience. The action was constant. It was relentless, it was bloody and it was just even more constant. I felt like it would never let up. I freaking loved every second of it. They really went fully into town with this, especially with that star studded cast starring Donnie Yen, Yuri Boyka himself (Scott Adkins) and of course some familiar faces from the previous installments. This was by far my favorite John Wick installment.",9
mrdivot,"While I feel that the first three films were topnotch I was a little disappointed by this one. Far too unbelievable to almost the point I almost couldn't tolerate watching the entire thing. The clencher was the shooting scenes at the Arc de Triomphe. Honestly, people continuing to drive through the shootouts was on the ridiculous side. Nobody in their right mind would drive through hails of gunfire.

They also made John Wick more or less a superhero. When I see someone get up after landing on their back from a 40+ foot fall and jump right up like nothing happened is brain numbing. Ditto for the bad guys. The big dude with gold teeth gets his throat slit and three shots in the back yet can still fight like a madman is something right out of the Friday the 13th kind of film. I give it a 5/10.",5

Nothing comes closer to this... Action you have never seen and what you can never imagine is what wick stands for...This is not the end folks..He will return.,10
petecurran,"I was entertained throughout. The almost three hour run time felt like 20 minutes. Amazing fight sequences, over the top, ridiculous but the film knows that and plays on it. I loved all the films and was a little worried they may have over stretched it with a fourth instalment. I was wrong, it was the icing on the cake. Immensely satisfying and very well filmed. There is an amazing aerial sequence where you see John Wick shoot the bad guys moving through different rooms ( much like a computer game, which I think was its intension). I had the widest smile when it paid a deliberate homage to another classic from the 1970s, The Warriors. If you want Oscar nominated deep and meaningful stuff, this is not for you. If you want an escape from reality and have a great three hours of mindless violence, superb choreography, not much of a story, this is for you. The director has put together a masterclass of an action movie together, the body count alone goes into hundreds and goodness knows how long it took for the actors to do all the stunts. Sheer joy, hugely recommended.",10
trevor_alex,"Where to start ? It follows on from the events of chapter 3 and from the word go - it was leading up to something extraordinary and as the movie developed over time it was breathtaking and funny in parts which kept the audience entertained !

The action sequences were remarkable and the introduction of Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanoda was very clever and Scott Adkins character was well done and played Killa's part super well and looked totally unrecognisable !

The Paris scenes were unbelievable and that car chase and fighting scenes around the Arc de Trioumphe was stunningly thrilling and the choice of music really resonated well during that scene.

Overall - It felt like a proper action movie made for the fans and delivered beyond expectations yet again ! I never felt so happy to come out of the cinema since Top-Gun Maverick ! I hope the rest of Hollywood are watching this and witnessing how an action movie should really be made ! Well done Chad ! You have outdone yourself yet again !",10
chirilescemanuel,"I'm in awe of how right the 4'th movie has conquered my emotions in a wholesome manner. It was so John Wick that i can't express a single counterpoint about it.

I didn't expect more from the 4'th film, no major plot twists, no grandeur ending, only the right emotion, and I got what I've been expecting, nothing less.

Feel like this kind of approach from the film industry where balance for what the movie is made to provide is much more appreciated. It feels more reliable as a whole. I'm not an expert, but I can see through the expert eye and take apart if something doesn't feel right.

Movie has provided, and I received.

Exceptional! 10/10.",10

paulholness-22062,"Have loved the previous films but this is a just Holywood doing what Holywood does and sucks every dollar out of a franchise after 20 minutes of relentless gun and knife play I actually started to get bored it was groundhog day without the laughs .The villain was the least scarey posh boy villain ever ,a slight tap on the chin would have ended him. Most of the fight scenes were well done but every now and then the quality dropped and became unconvincing as if they were inappropriate hurry to release it. IWatched it at home rather than the cinema so I could at least pause it .A film too far maybe ?",4
noahpatel-47357,"Gave me another reason to hate the French, phenomenal film. My dislike for the french began at a young age when i found out that France existed and they had the same rights as the regular person. This movie contained the exceptionally villainous character of Marquis played to perfection (or as near to it as a french man can get) by the non-french actor Bill Sk√•rsgard. Bill's performance was legendary and will not soon be forgotten by avid enjoyers of the john wick franchise, nor by avid haters of the french. The Marquis being the main enemy of the movie really emphasised the evil of the french population and how they can be evil. However not all french individuals are evil, for example the rat, remy, in ratatouille is a stand up guy and the chef gusteau from the same movie was also a great guy and the imaginary version in remy's mind was an impeccable character. However i still regard the french as lesser men because i have a ""friend"" who is descended from french men and he's annoying, like a French man.

So overall i rate john wick chapter 4 a 10/10 Ratatouille is a 9/10.",10
Wingzzz,"I want to start by saying that if you have seen any of the John Wick films and DIDN'T like them then odds are you're not going to like this one either. I only say that because this movie is even longer and has even more action than it's predecessors, and I'm sure that doesn't appeal to some. However if you dig these films, oh boy you're in for a treat.

I will say that in the story/plot department, this movie is certainly a bit thin and the narrative comes through in slightly inconsistent waves, but don't get me wrong there is some really good 'stuff' here in the story. Admittedly, I'm a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to writing/ story in media, but when it comes to John Wick 4 I just don't even care. The magic that Chad Stahelski, Keanu Reeves, etc., were able to create is more than enough to satisfy

In this film the ante has been upped. The fights are even bigger and better, full of moments that had me awe-inspired. The cinematography is exquisite, creative and engaging. The costume design/set design was beautiful. The sound design/audio is great. The powerful ensemble cast is amazing. There are a ton of newcomers in this movie and they all have their time to shine but oh man did Donnie Yen steal the show for me. I love his character 'Caine' and would love to see more of him in some capacity in the future. As always Hollywood's humble hero, Mr. Reeves, does outstanding and should inspire us all to be healthy and get in the gym!

The people behind this franchise deserve so much credit and admiration in my opinion. They have revolutionized the action genre in western media, bringing incredibly refined fight choreography/cinematography that will hopefully challenge other filmmakers to answer the call and meet the John Wick standard. Hopefully the days of over edited, nausea inducing shaky cam are far behind us.",9
shubhamshelar-04949,"Best action of all time , this movie is going to be remembered classic action movie of our era for future generations.and for now it has set a benchmark on how an action movie should be . Incredible performance by Keanu Reeves.

Beats all the previous parts however the 1st part is my favourite and will always be .

The birds eye/ snakes eye views steals the show ,will make you feel that the cameramen worked his ass hard.

Surprisingly the dark dialogues were able to get a laugh out of you in some scenes.

Justice served for john in the end of the movie.

PS : there is a post credit scene at the end.",10
imdb-23821,"I'm going to get hundreds of downvotes even though I do love Reeves and he's always cool. The first two were great. But this has become nothing but an action killing porn film. It wasn't even disguised that the plot is completely unnecessary and that every really cool backdrop, stylish villain, mystical dialogue is just filler for the ambiance. Mass murder takes place and bystanders don't even bother to take notice. They are just background dressing for the endless, nonstop choreographed fighting.

Don't get me wrong. The sets are beautiful. The wafer thin characters whom you know nothing about act cool. The dialogue about The Table and each other are mystical in a bad karate film kind of way. I had a hard time knowing whether this was just a parody of those films. And in the end, which is itself another endless fight that is clearly over the top (and our hero seems totally invulnerable like playing a video game in god mode), we have another end which... will there be another sequel?

I really miss the cool, badass with a couple of witty lines we saw from the first two. In this film, the only words I recall Reeves saying were a handful of items about the dead and... ""yeah."" Sums it up.",5
bobbyem-1,"So I was hoping this one was gonna deliver more in terms of story and character but sadly no. All the same beats as before, all the same tropes from the previous films and the only thing holding it together is Keanue and Donnie Yen.

The world of John Wick is a small world, everyone in it is an assassin and that makes assassins mundane and boring. The movie takes place all over the world and characters teleport at a moments notice making the world feel even smaller.

John is not a very interesting character, he was in the first one where we got to know him, but now that we do know him there isn't much going on. His persistence and skill is the only thing interesting about him and that's not enough to carry a movie this long.

The whole ""High table"" thing is so lame. They really don't know what to do with it and now that the series has been all over the world and killed everything that moves 100 times over the threat of the HT is pretty much like being scared of the IRS.

I hope they keep making films with this level of skill and love but for christ sake, put some effort into the scripts!!!",6
SnoopyStyle,"John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is killing people all around the world. He is taking on The High Table. The Marquis Vincent de Gramont (Bill Skarsg√•rd) destroys the Continental for their failure to kill Wick. Caine (Donnie Yen) is a blind assassin. Wick uses an old High Table tradition, but he has to battle through an endless supply of assassins.

I'm sure that everyone is saying that the Arc de Triomphe is the best action, but I like the stairs better. With CGI, one is always questioning what is real and what is fake, today. For sure, I see a lot of the Arc action can be real, but one is never sure. The main faking on the stairs is using stuntmen. I don't mind that as long as Keanu does most of it. Also, I like the long takes on the stairs. In fact, I would like the takes to be even longer. That's the best. It's fun to take this franchise to outside and in exotic locations. The action is non-stop. Quite frankly, sometimes it can overload me, but I can't complain. This is the rule of sequels, bigger and more.",7
Jithindurden,"It's like they thought about how to shoot every type of action scene in its absolute perfection and the most beautiful way, and just went ahead and did it. Almost three hour-long action spectacle that feels non-stop but they do take enough time in between to stop and breathe and those are some genuine breaths using the heart. Even though this and first is my favourite in the franchise, they did stretch the logic to the maximum in this. The way the action works and the world works in this movie felt like it used video game logic, the health bar fills up if you stay still and the NPCs are only scared for a second and go back to what they do if you don't bother them. Nonetheless, this is a theatre experience like none other.",8
bramptonbynature,"Be prepared because your body will not be prepared for the onslaught on your senses. John Wick Chapter 4 is cinematic action perfection. The movie entertains you every minute and gives you every ""bang"" for your hard earned bucks. The best John Wick, and I don't say that lightly. Keanu Reeves barely has any lines but commands the screen with his physicality. The rest of the cast is iconic, Donnie Yen and Bill Skarsgard being major stand outs.

There are multiple actions scenes, some I have never seen in a movie before. Camera Angles, Tension, Lighting Technically made at such a high level your jaw will be on the floor at moments and you won't even realize it. At least in my case I found myself picking mine from floor multiple times.

Big shout out to Chad Stalhelski too, very rarely does a 4th movie surpass its predecessors but he's found a way. He never lets the audience off the hook, maintaining a razor sharp focus in all of the scenes. Just inspiring work and I can't wait to see what he cooks up next.

If you haven't figured already, I highly recommend this movie. Go out now and watch it on the biggest screen possible, with a bucket of popcorn, you will not be disappointed.",10
kerry-white77,"10/10. 100/100 Only a few films I can call Masterpieces, even my 10/10s or 5/5 stars, I don't typically depict as masterpieces, but this one definitely IS. In every aspect.

The gun-fu, choreography, fighting, stunts, and action in general. The acting, story was the best of the franchise, and the directing. The cinematography and overall feel of the film. And even other aspects that I would consider at least near masterpiece parts that make the whole, such as the score.

And watching with an audience made it even better. The reactions to the scenes and the visceral action sequences that took place, made them all the better. Laughing with an audience at perfectly timed comedic moments, and hearing some comments about what's happening on screen; something about a relaxed, chill, and engaging audience just ties a movie together in a nice little bow. The perfect experience one such as myself absolutely LOVES about going to the theater. And it reminds me of one of the main reasons why I go.

If you get the chance to watch this film at a theater, DO IT. Especially one with a decent amount of audience members. It's a damn good experience that one should NOT miss out on.",10
akshatmahajan,"John Wick Chapter 4 was one of the most awaited sequels of 2023. After what happened at the end of Chapter 3, I was interested to know what will happen next.

The movie was fully action-packed like the previous installments but the action scenes were more intense this time. The story was a simple continuation of the previous part. The performances by all the cast members were good and memorable.

One different and new thing I noticed in this part was that the movie had a lot of emotional elements attached to it. This felt a little bit weird to me as the previous installments only focused on action and nothing else. I faced one more problem and that was the pacing of the movie. The movie felt fast at some moments and slow at other moments, in other words, the pacing was inconsistent. The runtime also felt a little bit long but the overall experience doesn't get affected by it.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie and it was a good entry in the John Wick franchise even after having the same old story.",7
wewaj-03329,"Hey all, I have to come and post here about Mr. Wick since I rarely do and I just saw this movie yesterday with my 75yo Father who came to visit from Kelowna and my 19yo Son who came to visit from Regina.

This movie is special, it's special in way that the action, story and overall characters are just something that we don't experience much today in Movies. And of course I'm the middle aged guy at 46 watching this movie with both my father and son that made it a legendary experience.

It's really amazing to think that this kind of movie can make 3 different generations come together and actually get excited to see and experience it and not only love it, but it's like a cult following now for us. No other franchise or movie has done this to my family and we all left wanting more...

I also rarely go to the theatres nowadays but this one is hands down one meant for the Theatre as most of the people reacted the way we did and definitely made a much better experience and more fun!! Which is what all of this is about right?

Anyways, I hope there's more out there like us that bonded with many generations and this is why we go to the movies!!! :D

Thank you Keanu and the entire cast of John Wick, you will be in our hearts forever <3.",10
cedricdumler,"Ecstatic. Esthetic. Artistic. Cathartic. Masterfully filmed, designed and visualized. Quite possible the most sensually intoxicating cinema experience I've had. A simplicity that feels almost poetic. In the midst of all the action, you suddenly question the meaning of life. Only to then again fall back into John Wic's gun-fu exstasy. Like clockwork. On and on. Keanu Reeves, who has maybe 2 pages of dialogue in the entire film series, manages to embody a character that is fascinating, questionable and yet understandable at the same time .

There's hundreds of action movies. And yet there is an abundance of action setpieces in chapter 4 that have never been put on film before.

The magnum opus of action craft.

A loving husband.",10
roexpat,"How long can one watch perfectly choreographed action scenes? The director figured on close to 3 hours, I called it a day after just 1. This movie is so far from the first, or even the second installment in the series that it might as well be called something else and star someone other than Keanu Reeves. The acting and story are not only wooden and trite, but somehow manage to become annoying. Anyone who utters a word becomes instantly unlikeable. The far-fetched action is way past unrealistic and firmly in the realm of fantasy. When it's comical you can't be sure that it's intended or simply part of the ridiculous smorgasbord of run and gun. Is it self-aware? Maybe, but it's certainly self-absorbed. It's the epitome of aiming for ""bigger and better"" and succeeding only in the size department.

3 stars for the hard work put into creating this. Shame about the result.",3
amqadri-27191,"The action from start till end is amazing and so much eye popping. I am in love with the series. The way it is directed from start till end is mind blowing.

GREAT JOB TEAM ""JOHN WICK""

I am curious what will happen to high table and who is the boss of all, will john come back to end the table and free all others who are stuck in this life? Who will continue his legacy to fight whole night with whole city.

I am desperately waiting for chapter 5 and wishes that Mr. Wick continues the franchise. Wants to see the continental again.",10
classicsoncall,"Have you noticed how the John Wick sequels gradually progressed in length? The original ran at an economical hour and forty one minutes. JW#2 just made it over the two hour mark at 2:02, and JW#3 came in at two hours and ten minutes. This one lasted almost three hours, 2:49 to be exact., and if you throw in the credits, probably the full three. It's pretty obvious why, how else do you cram in even more fights, gun battles, chases and such to up the ante in successive films. And boy of boy, did this one bring things up several notches! The story itself is almost superfluous to the action, but after a while it gets almost comical. By the time John (Keanu Reeves) rolled down the stairs for the third time, I wasn't the only one emitting an audible chuckle. Someone in the theater behind me also felt the irony of Wick's miraculous ability to survive multiple assassins, fall out of buildings, and get right back up after being hit by multiple moving vehicles. All done to pulse pounding music and incredible action cinematography, highlighted by that incredible dragon breath gun fight with flashing pyrotechnics. Lest you think I'm being critical, I do enjoy this kind of stuff but you do have to enter a film like this with some semblance of disbelief. And come on now, do you really think there's a body under that headstone marked 'John Wick'; there's no date for one thing, and the lengthy credit roll finally gives rise to a scene in which Akira (Rina Sawayama) comes gunning, er..., knifing for Donnie Yen's character. I don't know if the next one will be called John Wick #5, but if not, they might try going with 'The Caine Mutiny'.",8
ataeracar,"First of all I want to start by saying that this film, in any shape or form will satisfy you if you're a die hard John Wick fan like me.

It has caught my attention that the reviews for Chapter 4 has been nothing but high scores and prasing reviews... (Even people saying that its the best chapter!) Sadly I couldn't figure out exactly why.

The first and the biggest problem in my opinion is that the film includes close to none character development. For me, a John Wick movie must, and I say this again, must make you eager for the thought of John Wick taking his revenge from other villians. However in this movie sadly all you get is unlimited bodies thrown at John and no sense of that anger and fury.

Another problem is that the film is absurdly unrealistic. Of course we all know that John Wick movies are supposed to be unrealistic to some degree but this one makes you want to leave the theater... The cringe caused physical pain on my body.

The last thing I want to mention is that the movie didn't feel like a sequal to any chapters. There are so many new characters that you actually get lost. Honestly you could go watch it without seeing any of the chapters and have little to none problem understanding the story. Sadly it felt completely like a different movie in a bad way.

TLDR: Worst chapter of the sequal. Unrealistic, and boring. No sense of the John we know of. Too much action and not enough story. Of course these are my opinions, go watch it for yourself. Hope you enjoy it.",3
nathangoffnett,"From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.

One of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.

But perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.

One slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.

Overall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

Score: 93% Verdict: Excellent.",9
rosebudfr,"Well I went to Montmartre and the Sacr√© Coeur today, just to make sure, and let me tell you it isn't exactly like in the movie. Even at 6 am you'll find the stairs full of random dudes playing djembe and sleepless students drinking cheap beer waiting for the sunrise. It would actually have been fun to include them in the final scene, but what do I know?

My real problem with this film though is that JOHN WICK 4 is so detached from any kind of reality it makes it a rightful candidate for the fantasy genre, what with its HIGHLANDER-friendly references to ""consecrated grounds"", love of stylish church interiors and absurdly invincible, nearly-immortal characters. Ok I actually kind of like that part, and I expect new installments to reveal that Da Vinci, Rambaldi (ALIAS) or the Knights Templar started the High Table organization, which would be fun.

No, my real quibble is when the gun play becomes so fantastic than they can shoot each other repeatedly at close range and keep fighting as though this were a superhero-type action flick. They lost me after about 15 mn of story when that kind of nonsense started, in Osaka. I did enjoy some brilliant John Woo-like choreography (the overhead sequence shot most of all), but nonsense like that really spoiled the fun for me (and for the Paris audience who giggled when Wick keeps falling down the Montmartre stairs - there's no way this could happen in real life).

This is a classic case of sequilitis really, with bigger, louder and absurder as the guiding principles. Give me the same film with fewer set pieces and shorter by an hour and I would be much more satisfied. Oh, and without the teflon-coated, IRON MAN-esque suits please.",6

I like that this is the last John Wick movie because The way that the movie end is fabulous and makes me (as John Wick fan) feel good and pleased

I like to say thanks to keanu , director ,writer and the hole team about this action movie .",10
dilipbts,"That lasted 169 minutes? I had no idea. The time just flew right by.

Chad Stahelski does not pull any punches (or engage the safety) at any time in this gun-fu epic. Combat scenes are not moments so much as they are entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography that everybody had to synchronize to was rather incredible, and they continue to find more ways to entertain us with kills, kill types, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, etc. I caught myself smiling for minutes on end several times while watching it.

Of course though, as I said, they really lean into it. I'm sure this has been true of previous films as well, but it is very apparent that John Wick should virtually die in every scene that he is in. Whether it is how he is attacked or how they fail to attack him at the right times, he goes at every foe like the bear in The Revenant with full adrenaline and no signs of slowing down no matter what he is hit by. And again, I think if you look hard enough you will find enemies who have clear shots and choose not to take them because of plot armor, but you can forgive it enough if you're rewarded with a longer take or overall longer action sequence. What I really loved was how many of these scenes took place at night with dazzlingly lit environments all around, and the music in every scene kicks as much *** as what you see on screen. I had pondered over why John Wick doesn't have a video game yet, but if they ever make one I have decided I'd like one of those top-down shooter games (similar to The Hong Kong Massacre, and if not maybe like the GTA:SA MP rampage style).

I acknowledge this franchise for what it is now, but I still pine for some of the missing components that I don't know if it'll ever be able to bring back. After watching John Wick, fun as it was, I found myself interested in seeing a prequel when he was the Baba Yaga in his prime, taking missions rather than being hunted. Even still, at least in that movie he was absolutely feared. In Chapter 2, I still found him heavily respected, but it was in that movie that I realized there would probably be a repetitive formula to the narrative and movie/action structure (which still has yet to break). In Chapter 3, there only lived assassins and they would go after him without hesitation, which did is not how I felt the world breathed the first time around. They continue down this path in Chapter 4, while opening the universe more to different characters breeding their own kind of loyalty. They are all insanely fun to watch, and you see the cogwheels of the John Wick universe spinning with the future Continental television show and the Ballerina movie spinoff. Where they remain faulty though is even with the existence of civilians during fight scenes, they act as droning NPC's like nothing is happening around them, or they aren't there whatsoever. It is clear that this is not our world that this movie takes place in, but rather a parallel one.

I mentioned the introduction of new characters in this world, and you can't not bring up Donnie Yen when talking about them. He steals each and every scene that he is in, and it's crazy because you wonder how a character like his could thrive in such a world but you absolutely believe it when you watch it. I will absolutely take more of him and Rina Sawayama. She isn't featured as much, but she makes use of every second that she is in front of the camera. There are plenty of others (such as the great Hiroyuki Sanada), but the point remains that Wick is relegated to this greater universe with characters who-good, bad, or for themselves-are ones we can actually root for in any fight. Keanu Reeves is understandably less nimble at his age than the others (and it's either bad acting or he really has taken on this John Wick role in his line delivery to hilarious new heights), but he and Stahelski have found a groove that still makes him the most impenetrable force around, to the point that I go back and watch the action scenes in The Matrix Resurrections and wonder what happened there. I didn't love one particular character in their big fighting moment(s), but they go for versatility and I have to give them that much.

March has had an incredible run of theatrical films, and John Wick: Chapter 4 is no different. You will lean forward during the action which there is plenty, and if I'm one to go off of you will not feel the runtime. There is an end credits scene as well if you're able to stay for a moment longer. I would love to go back and see this one again.",9
atlasmb,"And so the story of Wick continues. And it continues to be stylistically Tarantinoesque. Brutal fight scenes are highlighted by well-paired popular songs.

But the action---which centers around Wick's battle against the entire world of assassins, it seems-feels like a throwback to the ""Enter the Dragon"" days of Bruce Lee, with one man against impossible odds. And the Asian influence permeates most every scene, even when the action leaves Asia.

There is also what might be a reference to the blind swordsman. And one opponent is named Caine, which could be a reference to the hero from television's ""Kung Fu""

Though wick is forced to reduce his life to a series of deadly eliminations, he maintains scraps of his humanity, particularly when interacting with animals.

But make no mistake: this film regales in its stratospheric body count, however artful the executions.",7
cjonesas,"As I'm preparing to write a review for this ""gem"" of a John Wick movie, I come to my senses and remembered in time that I dozed off most of the better half of the movie, from Paris to ""Berlin"" and back, so to speak. I do remember the Eiffel tower, the 30 paces rules and the famous or rather infamous stairs. 222 stairs to be climbed and fight on with party shoes; Poor toes.

I also remember 'neck' and 'nuts' and those beautiful ""puppy"" eyes begging for ""clemence"" and forgiveness for John Wick who tenderly saved her life.

All those and the Japanese ""Daredevil"" with his range of katanas, I quite liked, no matter the logic, lack of or improbability of the situations with All bad guys coming in dancing and waltzing instead of shooting from a safe distance or doing jerky slow-motion movements right under John Wick's nose.

What I didn't like, just a little, was the fake and insufficient blood trails and cherry wounds resulting from the duel and John Wick alone on those stairs, seeing his life slip before his eyes in a 35 degree kaleidoscope. Over 2h45 minutes of invincibility potion for John Wick for the pleasure of our eyes and pillows under our ears. Don't you dare not give us 'John Wick 5' in 2025.

And most importantly, I loved Lance Reddick as the Concierge in all 4 movies. The best. RIP.

jasonkentmartin,"If you're like me and have been less than thrilled with the recycled superhero, boring, propaganda-infused migraines that have been in the theaters for the last few years, then here's your sign to go: John Wick Chapter 4. Being an ardent fan since the release of the first one, I've been cautious going into each subsequent film, waiting to be let down and end my love for the franchise. This movie did the exact opposite. Waaaaay over the top action, infused with a lot more humor and tongue-in-cheek sequences, this movie delivers. So much so, I was disappointed to hear there may not be a fifth chapter (as was originally planned), not to mention saddened by the passing of Lance Reddick. The John Wick universe stays fresh and fun four movies in and does not disappoint. Hopefully this isn't the end (insert John Wick's subdued response, ""Yeah"")!",10
sanjesireland,"I am so happy this movie turned out to be an actual blast firing on all cylinders. Keanu Reeves has never been this good in the series: the stunts and the gravitas he brings to both the character and the film are superb. He and the while team behind the film have been wise enough too to surround him by a whole pack of terrific players (The Blind Man, Mr. Nobody) in order to enhance the experience. There are some breathtaking tracking shots and the main action sequences (Osaka, Germany and Paris) are outstanding. Paris is definitely my favourite. Culminating with a daring, bold surprising ending 'John Wick Chapter 4' is everything you want in a movie now. Go and see it now!",8
lazygetter,"I went in with high expectations and was disappointed tbh.

Lots of plot holes. The runtime is just padded with action that isn't that great. It's like a damn video game. Come on. The first John Wick is the best purely because the action feels real.

The plot is also sorta weak. Few characters are not required at all for the plot to happen. Why did they need the whole blind angle? Why go the Daredevil path? WHY?! The tracker character was not required too. His presence didn't change the plot in any way at all.

The fight scene, with the drone, before the end is basically a video game scene. Gotta be kidding me. As the ending scene developed, it was kinda predictable too. You mean tell me a god damn blind assassin is better than everyone else ? They are openly mocking us for giving them money for making dumb plots.

I wouldn't have felt bad if I had skipped it. I am a huge John Wick fan. The first movie with the ""focus, commitment, sheer will"" inspired me. This one doesn't even have that line !

Utterly disappointed.",5
AarushSRK,"The wait was worth it. John Wick 4 is the best of all John Wick. It has outstanding &mind blowing action scenes. Some of them you have already seen like the way John Kills with pistols but the car sequence & The fire Gun killing scenes will 100% blow your mind & the different camera angle makes it more unique! The movie is 3 hours long but Don't worry you are not gonna regret it... donnie yan the master has done amazing job, simply outstanding with his sword!! At some points you gotta feel for John. If you are a true john wick fan you'll understand the pain he's going through the whole movie.... the scene i liked the most in which john's driving car & killing bunch of peoples at the same timing, i bet you'll love it too!!!",10
paul-allaer,"As ""John Wick Chapter 4"" (2023 release; 169 min.) opens, Wick is chasing down 3 guys on horse somewhere in the Middle East. Wick ends up killing the head of the High Table. We then shift to New York...

Couple of comments: this movie is once again directed by Chad Stahelski, who has directed all Wick movies to date. In Chapter 4, there is a convoluted story, but who really cares. ""Don't bore us, get to the chorus"" as Roxette famously titled their greatest hits album, and right they are. There is plenty of action in Chapter 4, but it all leads up to the movie's final hour, which is absolutely insanely good. None more so than the Arc de Triomphe scene . I've never seen anything like it. Equally enjoyable is the thumping electronic score by Tyler Bates and Joel Richards. Working against the film is its overlong running time, I mean almost 3 hours. Why? Could've probably cut 45 minutes without losing any of the movie's essence.

The theatrical release of ""John Wick Chapter 4"" was delayed multiple times as a result of the pandemic, but finally did see the light of day a few weeks ago, and it's been another smash hit. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw it at here in Cincinnati was pretty much sold out. Bottom line: if you didn't like the John Wick franchise before this, Chapter 4 isn't going to change your mind. For the rest of us, by all means do check it out. This movie begs to be seen on the big screen and with lots of fellow Wick fans around you.",7
vadim-berman,"...but less brilliant movie.

I know it's John Wick. I was not expecting a philosophical meditation on serious topics. But c'mon!

The welcome little bits of comic relief like in John Wick 3 are gone. The last link with reality has gone up, up, and away, like a runaway party balloon. The characters are even more cardboard; you would've thought it's impossible, but apparently no. You could barely hear the main character talk over the overlong 3 hours running time.

One issue I'd like to focus on is the stereotypes. It's basically as if Tommy Wiseau ran National Geographic. The French guy eats creamy cakes (no croissants?) on business meetings. He is arrogant, impulsive, likes high art, and wears 18th century outfits. He lives in Paris, and all business meetings and pivotal plot points take place exclusively in (amazingly empty) touristy landmarks. The German guy is an obese asthma sufferer who always adds ""ja"" to his bad jokes that he always laughs at. Barely being able to breathe somehow does not prevent him from inflicting serious damage and running. In Berlin people just keep dancing while a bunch of gangsters with guns and knives are killing each other and breaking things. At some point, they decide it's too much for them and quietly go to their cars. The vaguely Middle Eastern country is where people ride horses, live in the middle of a desert in a tent with carpets, and their role in life is to say a piece of eastern wisdom and get shot (what for?). Japan is all shiny and neon-lit, and everyone talks, dresses, and acts like a XIX century samurai.

If it weren't for the cast and the marketing, the reaction would not have been as positive.",5

peterson-662-456569,"It's very stupid, no character drama, no monologues, no sense, only fight which reminds a mediocre action game with 1000 life saves. I didn't like it. A blind fighting master? You'are kidding me? The blind man won't be able to find the way out of the cinema auditorium by himself not even thinking of fighting and shooting in different locations. It looks like the directors and stuntmen wanted to show what else they can do. Look: a new stunt, look, one more or let't try this one....

I couldn't even tell when 3 hours passed and the movie ended.

Go to a cinema or see it in dolby atmos at home and thank me later.

All the new actors in the franchise did a very good job, and Keanu did what he knows better : to BE John Wick!.

All you have to do it's sit back and relax and enjoy the movie and all it has to offer with your own eyes.

Be seeing you.... Mr Wick.",10
dkayaus,"What a conclusion to John Wick quadrilogy. I couldn't have asked for a better ending. Absolutely brilliant action sequences, stunning lighting and beautiful cinematography. It has got everything. This movie has taken action movie genre to a whole new level and has earned the Legendary status in my books.

Chad Stahelski being a stuntman himself has proved why nobody could have directed John Wick better than he did. The locations where action sequences take place are carefully chosen.

I never write movie reviews but this movie forced me to write my first ever review on IMDB. I was in awe when the movie ended and left the theatre with a happy heart. It was perfect in all sense.",10
mhosseinest,"One of the best action movies in history. I really don't know how they made those sequences. The action scenes are very professionally designed. The lighting and sound are excellent. The synchronization of the music and the action sequences is wonderful. The actors are very good. They played amazing, especially the blind killer and Keanu Reeves. The only bad part of the movie was that John Wick was not injured very much, but it can be said that because of the jacket he was wearing, it was made of Kevlar, and Kevlar is stronger than steel at the same weight. And it is a very powerful impactor, and for this reason, John Wick was very little injured when hitting objects and being thrown. And the reason why the enemies do not headshot John Wick is that they are very beginners and it is very difficult and professional to headshot with a simple Colt caliber. And in all war training, they say that the priority is to shoot the body. In the movie, we saw that the bullets hit John's jacket at close range, and he put his jacket in front of the bullet like Zorro. The only problem with the movie was its long time. John Wick's death was very touching and sad. He was just a lonely man in love. My score is 10 for the tribute to Keanu and John.",10
arungeorge13,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is everything you can ask for in an action blockbuster, if I were to sum it up. We dive further into the lore of the High Table, the intriguing universe set in motion from the first film gets expanded with new (and significant) characters being introduced, but most importantly, the set-pieces outshine all else. We came for the action, we stayed for THE ACTION (of course!) and the collective brilliance that film offers. And by collective brilliance, I'm referring to the stylistic choices employed in each set-piece, right from a Lawrence of Arabia-like scene in the desert to an incredible showdown at a German nightclub, and the unforgettable stretch of relentless action in that Parisian final act.

Chad Stahelski excels in the staging aspect. He is currently at the top of the Hollywood-actioner food chain, and rightly so. The camerawork (by Dan Laustsen, who also shot the second and third outings) is fluid when it's capturing the set-pieces while also treating us to some breathtaking imagery, be it in New York, Osaka, Berlin, or Paris. The aerial frames are straight out of an RPG game, and that particular scene featuring the TTI Dracarys Gen-12 shotgun, looks insane, to say the least. I'd also give credit to the entire stunt department for pulling off that staircase sequence in Paris (good lord!). Also, seeing John Wick simultaneously wield a Nunchaku and a Glock was perfection!

Donnie Yen is such a kickass addition to this microcosm, both in terms of delivering high-octane action and playing a character that suits him to the T. Hiroyuki Sanada and Rina Sawayama get to be part of an exciting showdown in Japan, with the latter holding immense potential for the franchise's future. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne pop up during those moments the film needs them the most, offering us smiles and hoots. Shamier Anderson and his ""faithful accomplice"" (a Belgian Malinois, played by five different dogs) are splendid. Also, RIP Lance Reddick (you will be missed!).

Scott Adkins, as the quirky-yet-menacing Killa, rises to the occasion as a secondary antagonist, with him beating the crap out of Wick in a stunningly stylized set-piece. Bill Skarsg√•rd, playing the arrogant (primary) antagonist, is the ideal final boss. The hybrid score by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard fulfills the task of elevating the fast-paced action, resulting in frequent adrenaline rushes. The ending came off as a bit of a surprise, given there was early news about a Chapter 5. But the post-credit scene leaves enough room for one specific story to continue. Even at 2h 49m, Chapter 4 is fully engaging, leaving no stone unturned from an action-fanatic's perspective.",8
Aswinning_11,"Another epic and boring franchise ending, good! It's becoming more and more ridiculous kind of like the Fast and Furious series. Where do I start?

predictable plot line written by a 5 year old. Ex friend ex colleague gets killed/daughter survives/family blabla/cocky boss gets killed.


John fights a Caine, a blind man. Does not manage to kill him. The man is BLIND. John has the advantage (he can see and is a killer) yet still cannot win.


John gets hit by a car at least 4-5 times. Survives.


John fights off 30 bad guys in close combat. All armed and none manages to shoot his head. Survives.


John jumps out the window from the 3rd floor. Lands on van. Survives.


John travels in Paris with a fast bike. Somehow he cannot go to Sacr√© coeur with it. He has to stop and climb the 200 steps. He needs to learn how to ride like Tom Cruise.


Akira disappears in the middle of the movie. Seeks revenge for her father. Why not make her appear at the end and together they all fight the bad guys? At least it would have been more believable then some 58 year old man kicking ass to 50 deadly men.


Tired of movies using real cities but totally disregarding the reality of the city:
¬∞ shootouts in the middle of the streets of Paris and people barely notice.

¬∞ car chase in Arc de triomphe (a busy roundabout) and cars don't stop or slow down. It's a busy place and cars would slow down!

¬∞ empty Paris and sacr√© coeur despite 100s of rounds being shot. Apparently Paris (the busier tourist place on earth) is empty at 6 AM and Parisians are deaf.

sveinroar-39232,"JW C4 is the best movie in the franchise by far. I cant wait for C5. The move is action from beginning to the end. 2.45 running time goes very fast. The plot is well known, and it is done better this time. This is not a movie, it is art. This movie will stand as the best movie as CR has played in. If you love 1-2-3, this give you the finesse and thrill, all the other movies combined. We sat struck in the theater. The filming is ground braking. The sound is taking you inside of JW world. I hope to see this movie One time more in theater. A lot of details would be missed due to the focus you get in the scenes. This is must see for 2023. If you have not seen any of the other 3 movies.

nb99,"It's stylish, very stylish. It's smooth, slick, fast, beautifully put together and keeps you entertained for almost the full 2.5 hours (which is quite long for an action film). Ultimately though, it is just a martial arts film and so if long fight scenes aren't your thing you're probably not going to enjoy this no matter how pretty it is to look at. But if martial arts are your thing, you're in for a visual treat.

For what it's worth, I personally found the Osaka scene just a little bit too long. The Berlin one was superb and the some of the action in Paris was quite remarkable - notably the scene shot from above which was really excellent. Also the irony that the Parisien drivers on the Arc de Triomphe were far more lethal than 25 men with guns made me laugh! And to go with the stunning visuals is a great soundtrack throughout.

If action/martial arts are your thing, it's hard to see you not enjoying this movie. And it really is one of those films you need to see on the big screen to appreciate.",9
prolead,"There is art in everything and in JW4 it's the ballet of violence. From the get go, the movie unleashes artfully choreographed violence that involves weapons, martial arts and just pure raw hand to hand combat.

Ideologically, I am against violence but I saw this as art, a form of expression and when I saw it like that, it just felt like I was watching a dance performance. It just happens to be violence in this case. Keanu reeves is excellent, a little older but smooth and has given a 100% to every scene.

The movie runs quickly without wasting too much time on building narrative, most of it is simple, clear and precise. Is it realistic? NO, but you did come to watch JW4 so just enjoy the ride.",10

And then 2017 he played wick again and I missed seeing it in theaters. But now that I have the blu ray I love them . Now that John wick has finally completed his mission I hope Ian mcshanes character takes charge and maybe hires another wick . Maybe a female wick . Like maybe Jenna wick who's John's sister.",10
burlesonjesse5,"""Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back"". So says Keanu Reeves and he's definitely back for a 4th time in 2023's John Wick: Chapter 4. This ""wick"", well it still burns brightly even though it might signal the coda end to this immensely popular franchise (hint, hint).

Anyway, bearded hitman Wick now has upwards of a $40 million dollar bounty on his head. That's because he offed the Elder of the High Table (oops). Yup, if you've seen the previous John Wick installments, you know what's coming. Reeves gets his kill on with vested suit and a certain level of badassery in tote. ""Whoa"" is he.

So yeah, Keanu doesn't say much in ""Chapter 4"" but the screen presence is still off the charts. I mean he'll always be the Canadian Harrison Ford to me. The dude, well he's a physical actor by trade, all bruised and battered and one tough SOB. It's almost laughably implausible that the Wick-meister survives massive falls and two stair tumbling-s. Ouch.

Mr. ""Cool Breeze"" aside, the more you watch all the John Wick flicks, the more you realize it's not about revenge anymore. With ""Chapter 4"", you're seeing mainly Japanese cinema at this point, with samurai sword fighting and Kurosawa stuff and all that slice and dice jazz. I mean we're talking birds in flight violence, bone-crunching poetry, and nunchucks (""don't forget the nunchucks""). Like cinematic, habanero hot sauce, it just hurts so good.

John Wick: Chapter 4's director is Chad Stahelski (duh). He has only done four pics and they're all Wicks. Besides introducing a few new characters (two of which being a sightless assassin and a bloodthirsty canine), Stahelski fashions John Wick as a guy who has to fight because there's nothing else he knows how to do. It's almost fascinating and goofy at the same time. I mean does Wick eat? Doesn't seem like it. Does Wick sleep? Probably not. Does Wick use the bathroom? They might attack him while he's in there. Finally, does Wick take time to read a book or sip hot cocoa at Starbucks? Get real people. ""Chapter 4"" is all about Reeves kicking butt and it has just enough action takes for the fly-by, 169-minute running time. I'll pay $10.50 for that noise.",7

I can watch this atleast a dozen times more.

From start to finish, the flow of the story, the character development makes you sit at edge. Suspense was spot on, everything will be there infront us and still we fail to get what's coming. And when you finally arrive at that stake, the story had already been increased the stake before you realise.

nomanza,"I don't know how to describe this masterpiece of art. In a century of CGI and cut scene massacres. Best to describe it: I'm thankful being able to see the best action movie in the 21 century.

I enjoyed every dialogue, every scene, every perspective and - of course - every headshot. The whole movie is well thought out. Every second has the right to exist. In my 24 years of human being I was never hyped like this. My expectation was 10/10. The movie just had to disappoint me. But it didn't. It surpassed my expectations.

I talked to a friend and we both said that we could talk one hour about every scene. The desert-horse scene. The Tokyo-continental scene. The German-Club scene. The Paris-car scene. The shotgun-onetake scene. The Paris-stair scene. The dog scenes. The duel scene. And of course those little partly funny partly crazy scenes (for instance the dog pissing on somebody's face after demolishing him or the arrow in the knee upside down scene).

Every character is perfectly selected. And of course the story line and those details about the John Wick universe is well picked.

This is a masterpiece of art. Thanks Mr Reeves.",10

A great action movie fantastic stunts and fight choreography. God knows how they put it all together fantastic effort all around. The fight scene in the art gallery room is brilliant. The high above camera shot looking down at the flame thrower gun shootout is so cool, the camera stays fully focused on the action as it sweeps from room to room.

The 'steps' scene is brilliant and hilarious. Bravo to the stuntmen involved. The best scene for me was the Arc de Triomphe how they put that together is nothing short of a miracle. The shoot out and fighting in-between the weaving traffic is so well done hats off the Keanu and the stuntmen again.",8

A sensational entry into the action heavy franchise that is ""John Wick"" & quite possibly the best action film in years.

Keanu is an extremely underrated martial artist and actor for his disciplined techniques. He definitely deserves all the praise for his stunts as-well. I go into each JW film with an open mind of appreciation for the martial arts & fight sequences, the films are guilty pleasures to me as I can't take them seriously at all. This is not a shot at the film or it's direction, having camp is not a bad thing though. Mr Wick has surely come a long way since losing his dog & wife in the first film. Regardless, definitely will always be there day 1 for any Reeves film and can easily say this is one of his best ever put to screen.",10
tm-sheehan,"My Review - John Wick :Chapter 4

My Rating. 6/10

I can't say this Action Crime Thriller isn't entertaining but I can say it's an hour to long at 2hours 50 minutes .

If this genre is your favourite you'll probably enjoy it much more than we did .

With an estimated production budget of USD 90,000,000 this franchise obviously is a proven box office success but that doesn't mean it's a good movie in my opinion.

It's repetitive martial arts violence with basically the same plot line as John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum which again features his enemies from The High Table a council of twelve crime lords that govern the underworld's most powerful criminal organisations seeking his execution after his betrayal in previous the chapters.

Keanu Reeves as John Wick is starting to look very tired and old and the impossible implausible feats of physical violence must tire his stunt team that numbers 35.

As far as acting skill is concerned Keanu could almost phone in his brooding monosyllabic dialogue I know that's John Wicks persona but nearly 3 hours is just to much .

Top marks for spectacular cinematography and locations this one features Paris which is always a joy to watch.

Of course It should look good with the huge Production budget it has and the action is obviously well directed.

For movie lovers of endless comic violence but violence nevertheless and mega sonic noise with a simple implausible plot line that never really is explained you'll probably enjoy John Wick Chapter 5 and get your moneys worth .

I'm glad I got a free movie rewards ticket as it's the last John Wick movie I'll be seeing in a cinema.

I have admired some of Keanu Reeves many films especially the romantic comedies like Destination Wedding (2018) ,The Lake House (2006)and a favourite of mine A Walk in the Clouds (1995) and he's also a fine dramatic actor in movies like Speed (1994) and The Matrix .

However I think he's become far too comfortable with the John Wick character and I hope we get to see something new and interesting from him in the future.",6
paytoncartier,"This is (in my opinion) the best John Wick movie in the franchise. The way they go about telling the continuation of this ""Ghost looking for his graveyard"" is phenomenal. The new characters are all extremely exciting to watch and lovable. The choreography of the action sequences is fantastic and you can easily tell how much work was put into them. The camera shots (especially one in particular) were absolutely genius and beyond what I could have expected. This movie is fantastic. Everything about it is a fantastic way to end the story of John Wick. The ending. Wow. Although sad of course, it is a happy ending. It is all we could have asked for as fans of these movies.

This movie is a must see and is (IMO) the best John Wick movie they have made.",10
gimili3979,"I was apprehensive going into this movie because I did not like John Wick 3 at all. This movie was sort of a surprise.

It still lags the story and style of the first John Wick, but you could tell they tried to go back to the film's roots. One area where this showed up consistently was with the fighting and the soundtrack of the movie. The soundtrack of this film was very good, even imitating some of the action and soundtrack of the original film.

The one aspect of this film you will probably really enjoy is the fight scenes tied to the soundtrack of sounds during the fight scenes.

That was very similar to the original film even if trying to go back to the same type of story was more difficult. The fight scenes had more purpose, and the combination of the songs and the fighting worked very well. If nothing else, you should enjoy that aspect of the movie.

Do not go into this movie thinking about John Wick 3, which was an action mess. Except for one really long fight sequence, this film is more stylish and similar to the original one.",6
ehughes75,"I honestly don't get why this has such a high score on here.

The fight scenes just wouldn't end, it's like the crew were unable to say ""ok, that's long enough"". Keanu can act, give him some damned lines.... The thing I can not forgive is lifting entire scenes and soundtrack for the movie The Warriors, really??? WTF was all that about? Did they run out of ideas? This franchise deserves better treatment than that.

I felt bored through much of the movie, they could have edited a full out fro this movie and I never would have missed it. The Mr. Nobody character was half ass flushed out at best. Didn't care if he lived or died. At least give the guy a name that has not already been used the the fast and the furious movies. Just sad.",3
paah1944,"The first three JW movies were all gems in their own way. Best Keanu Reeves athleticism and same goes for support actors including the dogs. In JW 3 Hayley Berry and the two outrageous canines nearly stole the whole movie. Having said that with no Keanu there is no John Wick. The succession of bad guys is stunning they are all first class. It was sad to have the wonderful John Reddick pass away in real life which effectively removes a much appreciated support actor as the Continental Hotel Consierge and Ian Mcnees friend. This round of John Wick will be nearly impossible to top in the form of JW 5 if there is to be one. The ending this time does lend itself to a No 5. Drill down you will see that. Again toxic dog input so good. Nearly three hours long but it needs it.

Patrick.",10
zac-04879,"It's just simply not the sequel to fulfil everyone's wishes, but after two fairly dull instalments following the original revenge action-thriller model, the fourth chapter in the John Wick series is violent, slick and shocking. However, that's not to say that this movie comes without its flaws. Because even with its overlong runtime weakening the actual product, there's still some other issues that block it from ranking higher than the first film.

But if you've paid the entry fee with a craving mainly for kick-ass action with Keanu Reeves at the centre, visually striking direction and with a lack of care for sensical plot, you're in luck. Although each are usually several minutes too long, this film is loaded with the most distinctive and hooking combat fight scenes located throughout the entire franchise. For many, watching John Wick brutally shoot up a bunch of bad guys in a very stylistic fashion is entertaining, but the amount of damage taken by the characters is also where one of the film's most distracting plot holes roots between.

The reason a lot of the action scenes are all-fun-with-no-suspense-or-excitement is because it seems that damage and brutality doesn't really apply to John Wick, where everyone else he fights typically dies at the instant. He can go tumbling down a humorously long staircase and get shot or stabbed, but he can always get back up with seemingly no impact from the injuries. The motives presented by the characters is also a sizeable issue, giving the movie what feels like so many convoluted purposes to the point where the whole project could've just been thrown away and forgotten.

Some will agree that within the context of a film review, the critic needs to get the positives in first and finish with the flaws. This review doesn't follow that order because John Wick: Chapter 4 is still a decent action-thriller you'd want to leave off on a good note from. Anyway, this film is definitely the best of the sequels due to the fact that's it's entertaining, more distinctive, the writing is much better and there's surprises along the way to await for. It may have a runtime of nearly 3 hours, but it always feels like the plot is always moving forward, even if it gets a bit ridiculous at times. Performances by Keanu Reeves, Bill Skarsg√•rd, Scott Adkins and Donnie Yen also deliver some of the effect. If this is the finale to the overrun franchise, this is a solid way to come to an end.

AllanWB,"... I am of the opinion that John Wick Chapter 4 is the longest and least likeable of the franchise. Well, it's definitely the longest at close to three hours and the least likeable for me for the following reasons:

The fight scenes are way too long and ludicrously staged. The CGI blood spray in the fight scenes is laughably amateurish as is some of the choreography.

John Wick is an assassin, a human being. He's not endowed with superpowers. He can't fly or leap tall buildings although you wouldn't know it after watching this 4th outing.

It's down to the director and the script. It must have been an easy pay day for the writer because there's hardly any dialogue. We get a few monosyllabic grunts from John Wick and then another idiotic poorly done fight scene.

I think JW5 should go back to basics. Sure, keep the fight scenes that made the franchise famous but at least cut them down a little.",4

I truly believe that this franchise is by far the best action franchise ever created! Thank you, Chad and Keanu for creating a masterpiece.

lonesomer,"It is probably the best John Wick movie ever. Everything is almost on point. The director knows what people want to watch. The martial arts are so good to watch and are beautifully choreographed. All the casts played along with Wick. They did add the meaning to the movie. Less talk, more action. Something that I like from an action movie.

Been waiting this movie for a while. Can't wait to see the prequels. A must movie in March. You will not regret every minute you spend to watch this movie.

Freedom is something everyone may want to have in this life regardless of the efforts to achieve it. üòÉ",10
lakshyakaushik-91793,"If you're looking for a thrilling action movie, John Wick 4 is definitely the movie series to watch! Everything in this world revolves around rules, and it's been a while since I've seen a movie that captures this concept so well. The direction and use of lighting in the movie is simply phenomenal, and it takes the movie to another level.

There are moments when it seems like the action is over the top, but the movie quickly redeems itself with the next scene. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who loves action movies, as it is an incredible experience from start to finish.

The Continental grounds, the 9mm carbon pistol, crest, rules, and the setting in Japan with the sumo fighters were all executed flawlessly. The costumes, logos, music, dogs, cars, bikes, and horses added another layer of excitement to the movie.

I particularly enjoyed the dragon fire breath gun, which was just plain fun to watch. Overall, this movie series is a thrilling and exciting ride, and I'm looking forward to Lions Gate releasing more seasons and episodes in the future. The artistic direction of the movie series is definitely worth a praise, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good action flick.",10
lovekd,"Not just best John Wick movie but also the best action movie I've seen in a long time. The choreography, stunts and camera work are incredible. Dan Lausten and team delivered award worthy Cinematography, the music, costume design, different sets everything was well made.

Not a single forgettable character in sight. And Donnie Yen's brooo üî• Dude was literally Daredevil and I'm not exaggerating at all.

Not just any movie can called masterpiece everything about the movie must be perfect to call it a Masterpiece like Acting, Direction, Cinematography, Lighting, costume design, stunt choreography for action films, Background scores, Casting...etc all the things must be perfect and john wick was An Action Cinema Masterpiece truly a Work of Art, An Action Cinema at it's peak for sure.

Please Watch it on IMAX for best Experience your money will not be wasted for sure.",10
tilwinjoy,"The actions sequences don't flow like the first movie, people are waiting for their turn to attack.

People dancing in the club don't mind that people are throwing axes and killing each other in the middle of them. Of course their is a fight in a dance club during party with water flowing everywhere!

There is a scene where asians pick up their ninja throwing tools into a gun fight vs armored enemies... WTF?

Situations director put John Wick in are situations you won't survive even in a video game, no matter how good you are.

Some characters felt like they are just there for representation because it is 2023. The acting felt like they paid to be in the movie instead of being paid.

None of the characters have a strong presence or elegance unlike the first movie, dialogues include a lot of ""f you"", ""get your ass over there"" etc doesn't feel like a John Wick movie at all. John Wick just says ""Yeah"", ""I understand"" etc like someone's b*itch.

The only good part is hopefully they won't be making progressively worse movies to milk money off the name anymore.",4
tonyscleary,"NO STORY, just endless action and carnage, all of which hold no credibility and are just tedious choreography rubbish, I like Keanu but his so-called acting consisted of growling 2 or 3 words every 30 minutes. I know the premise of these is you need to suspend your disbelief but they need to develop some characters your care enough about to do this for, and sorry for the idea he loves Dogs and would save one over another human or himself (after killing a few 1000's ) is just trite, and lazy.

While we continue to reward this vacuous star-studded junk I guess they will keep ramming it down the Holywood pipe.",1
amunysaif,"I watched this movie in 4DX and it has to be the best action movie and one of the best movies I've ever seen

This has to be the best John wick and the best action movie EVER!!

The characters and the cinematography and the action and the casting all 10/10 Especially keanu Reeves and Donnie yen BOTH perfect casting

If this is the last John wick movie then it's a perfect ending for John wick's character even though it doesn't seem like it's the last movie because of the post credit scene but who knows that might be for a cain spin-off or maybe something else

If they ever make John wick 5 it would mostly ruin the ending for John wick's character.",10
julieshotmail,"Need I say more?

Well because of imdb's 600-character minimum requirement here, I'll oblige.

""John Wick Chapter 4"" is a spectacle of Keanu Reeves gracing the big screen with the nonstop backdrop of one beautiful cinematography after another. The first action sequence happens several minutes into the film and you wonder, this is nice, but where is Reeves? Could he be making the extras pull the weight this time instead of doing the action himself? Well nothing could be further from the truth! Once switched on, Reeves delivers immensely, leans in with total commitment, and is an awe to behold. You come here for fabulously choreographed fight sequences, and that is exactly what you get. Long, intricate, and entertaining. The blind man fight scenes are especially superb which is no surprise because we are treated to Ip Man himself, thanks Donnie Yen! Bravo for everyone involved. It is apparent that they put their heart and soul into this! Oh, and check out Rina Sawayama's singing career. What a voice and star power. She gives off Lady Gaga vibes.",9
Cylac,"I've watched chapter 1 to 3 several times and I still really enjoy them. This new chapter is good, but not as good as the previous three. It seems like they were trying too hard to add similar battles scenes from the previous films. The locations are amazing (it's amazing how he travels around the word so fast haha). Some of the fighting sequences were a bit too far fetches in my opinion compared to the other films. He's basically in ""god"" mode or all the people trying to kill him are former Storm Troopers. He falls from high balconies, off building, gets hit by several cars and even rolls down over 200 steps.. and still gets up like nothing. That ""suit"" of his must be highly padded to withstand all that abuse. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the film and I'll definitely watch it again.. it's just my least favourite of the 4.. and I love how they ended the film.. leaves it open to potentially more chapters or not.",7
markginn,"This was a total ripoff of the franchise. The story line was non-existent to say the least. Guys that talk about the action scenes have to be using excessive and excellent drugs. I'm a big fan of John Wick and every sequel was a growth and got better each movie, but not this one. It was like they slept walk through this one. No creativity, mundane action scenes, not impressed with even one. Instead of complaining about this movie, please someone tell me of any redeeming qualities. I was really disappointed in this sequel and again I'm a big fan of John Wick. The writers and directors get a big ""F"" for this installation. The only thing they did was close out the franchise on a very low note. Not well done by any aspect. Another couple of hours that I will never get back of my life.",1
agentdennisnissen,"This movie is amazing on all levels.

Best time spend in the cinema in a long long time.

So many perfect shots. Loved it big time.

If you like action adrenalin movies, you will love this.

I watched all the John Wick movies 3 times, and this will definitely get a rewatch when it comes out on blueray. This is a must have.

Great Cast, Great acting, Great koreografi, Great kamera angles, Great action, awesome music. Loved the tempo og the movie.

As an old dude (36), i'm very impressed with all the work Keanu Reeves puts his body through. I felt beat up in my own body, so many times during this movie. Keanu Reeves, just like Tom Cruise are some of the few, last real action Heroes <3.",10
miljanmartic,"Wow, I haven't seen such a bad and over the top movie in a long long time. The amount of risiculousness and bad acting surpasses even some of the Marvel movies.

For example, John falls 2 times from like 3rd floor height and is all fine and dandy. He gets hit by a car 6 or 7 times, and every time he just rolls off like nothing happened. The fight scene in a club is beyond ridiculous, with people just continuing to dance while they are shooting and chopping heads around them. Not to mention the ending with the ridiculous and exhausting staircase scene that just goes on and on.

I really feel like all these 9 and 10 reviews here are just review bombing, there is simply nothing else in my mind that can make sense that someone actually liked this movie so much.

Overall, 3/10 only because the scenes and cinematography are really beautiful at times, the music score is decent and that drone shot fight scene was pretty badass actually.",3
anoshchohan,"This is the best movie of all time, nobody can ever make a movie like that, Keeyanu sir always gave the best of him like in this series, really appreciate his efforts I just love this film, we want more and more chapters of John-Wick, because I am in love with this movie lots of love and respect for entire team, the action sceans of this film looks so realistic it never feel like the film it always hits me like all is 100 percent real, I want to beg of director that please never stop directing of more chapters because we really gonna miss John-Wick, and I wish that this film should won Oscar..",10
rcrdofjrdo,"The John Wick franchise has provided memorable action scenes and have propelled the uber-cool and super charismatic Keanu Reeves to new heights. Nevertheless, this movie in some form undoes what previous chapters have painfully built.

The story is unnecessarily convoluted and way too long to be entertaining. Motivations come and go, with no real substance rather than to keep the plot running. Most annoyingly perhaps is that action scenes feel somewhat recycled. For instance whatever was cool about animals in chapters 2 and 3 is rehashed here to little innovative effect. Even the actual physical setting: an early scene in the movie takes place in what felt like a too familiar museum-type of place with lots of neon lights and warrior masks and armors behind glass boxes. It's like things that were cool and worked out previously are just brought again. Lots of characters that are important to the plot, appear and disappear without having ever been mentioned before, creating some horrendous plot holes. All in all, it seems that there is so much that is forced and just ""more of the same"" cash-generating formula.

All of this would have been overlooked, if the characters were a little more real and less ""Fast and the Furious."" By this I mean that the action scenes and apparent immortality of certain actors have so much more in common with Vin Diesel and his gang than with earlier John Wick movies. No one important dies easily and there's a point that the logic of how someone can just keep going defies any common sense. Nothing feels at stake since you feel throughout the movie that John Wick will just keep going, not by sheer spirit and determination (as it was before) but rather by super-human abilities that, let's be honest, are just dumb.

As an audience member, I felt to some extent disrespected. The action and story in itself is so ilogical that there is no reason anymore to think more about any of these characters. Ian McShane's gravitas is lost. He's just playing the same role, saying the same things, looking cool, but adding so little. Same goes for Morpheus, sorry, Laurence Fishburne, who just do the same he did but somehow now in a different location.

All in all, a franchise that ran out of ideas and while beautifully filmed and with some exciting scenes, defies logic in so many ways it is hard to keep yourself interested or invested.",5
Ynocrozplatfom,"As with other action-packed movies of the franchise, this movie lives up to the John Wick name with well-crafted choreography and intense long shots. Yet similar to its predecessors, this movie still falls slightly short on the plot. The story feels dragged out occasionally, and rehashing the similar stakes only make the movie feel less thrilling. It is only the sustained originality with creative camera angles, weapon choices and distinctive combat styles for every main character that keeps adding something fresh to the franchise and fixes the audience's eyeballs on the big screen despite more than 2 hours of pure fighting.",7
amritbaruah-88189,"Overall story is good but the foundation was not that good as the previous franchises. Also in some scenes john wicks facial expressions were lacking. He worked hard to make this character as rugged as he possibly can; (with his stunts and fighting style) but some fightings scenes are soo long that it really bored some viewers. Story is good and its a 2.40 hrs long movie and i think it worth it but some unrealistic scene are made people yawn. Donny yein played his character very well but this is not possible that a blind man can fight in such a effective way, that was little too much. Although he already revealed that in a interview but somewhere it felt like his character was not properly utilised. Overall its an average movie, i mostly like the cinematography, editing, costume, action and every other small thing and its worth one time watching in a big screen.",6
roro_sa,"Always loved the John Wick franchise and going into this one I was prepared for lots of Action scenes.. And there were lots and lots of Action scenes. All the actions scenes were well thought out, well shot and properly executed. There is no denying the fight scenes came together excellently.

Problem is, I feel they focused so much on perfecting the action scenes that it took away from the underlying concept of John Wick.

John Wick the one known as the Babayaga, feared the boogeyman, a mythical man who's name shouldn't be uttered. A man who got out for Love, lived his life and who later lost the love of his life to disease, found some hope in a puppy gifted from his said love and then.. Well, we all know the rest...

The last installment had so many gaps or ommissions. John hardly speaks, no real conversations happen, no new quirky witty sayings.

Even going after the high table starts in the dessert and then ends as quick as it starts - this after almost the whole 3rd installment was set on finding the high table in the dessert...? They don't show who the high table is, he doesn't even get close to them...? Not even in New York. After all this, he just ends up killing the representation of the High table - again. What happened to 'Winston, tell them.. I'm coming, I'm going to kill them all..'

The guy with the dog - what was his back story? The whole time I thought he was sent by John's friend from the 3rd movie, ie Hailey Berry, to look out for John. But no, they wrote this guy in as a new character looking for a certain pay day. The story just didn't fit.

The opponent was like a Harry Styles version of a villain. There was no way that guy could be a high table representative.. It made no sense.

The scene where he stabs the tracker guy in the hand just didn't feel realistic. It felt like if the tracker guy stabbed him back in the hand and asked him to show him what kind of man he is, he (representative) would've passed out. It felt like he was all glamour and no grit.

Talking about dogs, John not once spends any time with his dog in the whole movie. They bring the dog in the end of the movie, but never with John. How could this be? Johns dog is an essential part of Johns character, his humanity. How did they miss this?

The King of the streets, also had such little airtime. They don't show how he helps John other than bring him his cavalier suit. There was so much more to him they could've brought into the story, but didn't.

Johns friend, who gives him refuge dies at the hand of Caine, but why? It made no sense to kill him off. Then they leave the story of the daughter who asks John to avenge her father's death hanging in the air. It was so unnecessary.

I did still enjoy the movie but am saddened by the fact they ended it the way they did. I expected a lot more, and not the measly 2 minute unalive scene they gave him.

There was so much potential they missed... The high table could've offered John a seat at the table, and we see him either reject it or work his way through it from the inside..",8
mjavsny,"So.... I thought I loved JW. I certainly love the first one. Imo, the first JW is one of the best action movies of all time. It was a story with heart - it had a reason for being. And I realized about myself, what I love most in a movie are the parts where you a) discover the protagonist's ""powers"" b) learn about a new world and 3) real people doing extraordinary things. That was my JW, the Baba Yaga. A legend brought back to life because someone stole his car and took his dog. Perfection.

Fast forward till now and over hours of my life, JW has eroded into some kind of cartoon. The man should be in a full body cast at all times but no, he just bounces around like a rubber ball, seemingly mad at himself at certain points because he keeps getting back up. The premise of JW is that he's an extraordinarily TALENTED man - not Wolverine - yet he is now a superhero. And much of this movie didn't make sense - why wasn't his rage directed at Winston?!? He was the one who betrayed him in the 3rd movie. His reasons for all his actions aren't compelling at all any more....in reality, if he's THIS MAD he should be going after the cancer research centers that didn't save his wife.

If all that you ever loved about JW is the shooting, well, this will be your jam. There's plenty. But...it's not good. Not like the OG. Sigh.",5
demolution-17666,"For someone who is middle aged, Keanu Reeves can still move as good, along with Donnie Yen (whos to be expected, from his martial arts experience).

There were a few scenes that was slow, however made sense, as it caught up.

With Donnie Yen in the movie as well (Caine), wow seeing Donnie and Keanu fighting against each other was a dream come true.

One thing i can say about Donnie Yen, there's a certain scenes, which I was shocked about (good way) and laughed.

There maybe some slow scenes, but it pays off with the action and you won't be disappointed with the fight scenes, the director made sure of this.

I won't spoil it, please do see this at the theatres - it's worth the wait, almost 3 hours.",10

Erwin Nasution Create a review about John Wick Chapter 4 movies where the action is very impressive, you should watch in IMAX, and John Wick character is like = John Rambo + John McClane + John Matrix + John Connor

John Wick Chapter 4 is an action-packed movie that truly deserves to be watched in IMAX. From start to finish, the action sequences are mind-blowing and leave you on the edge of your seat. The film follows the story of John Wick, played brilliantly by Keanu Reeves, as he battles against the High Table, a ruthless organization of assassins that he once served.

The fight choreography in John Wick Chapter 4 is some of the best in recent years, with every punch, kick, and gunshot feeling intense and impactful. The scenes are well-shot, with excellent camera work that puts you right in the middle of the action. It's clear that the filmmakers put a lot of effort into making each fight look unique, and they succeed in creating a variety of thrilling set pieces.

What's also impressive is how the character of John Wick is portrayed. He's like a combination of some of the most iconic action heroes of all time. He has the stoic and determined attitude of John Rambo, the resourcefulness and wit of John McClane, the raw power and intensity of John Matrix, and the strategic mind of John Connor. Reeves delivers a fantastic performance, conveying a sense of desperation and resolve that makes you root for him throughout the movie.

Overall, John Wick Chapter 4 is a must-watch for action movie fans. It's a thrilling, adrenaline-fueled ride that showcases the best of what the genre has to offer. With impressive action, fantastic performances, and a gripping story, this movie is definitely worth seeing in IMAX.",9
ckhr,"This film took a lot from video games and it works greatly. It felt like John Wick was going through levels each one containing a boss fight. I love that idea for these type of movies. Please give me more.

Immaculate action choreography. Incredible shots. Beautiful sets. Amazing casting. Superb gun play. Insane martial arts. Donnie Yen Donnie Yen Donnie Yen oh and did I mention Donnie MF Yen? Hirokuyi Sanada was in it briefly but nothing but gold from him.

There is a scene in front of the Arc De Triomphe that absolutely shattered anything I knew about choreography. Given most of it was CGI but still. There was a lot of practical effects during that scene.

I have nothing bad to say about this movie except that I didn't want it to end.... this is my first 10/10 in a while and it's well deserved.",10
Braga_HK,"John Wick 4 is a disappointing sequel that fails to deliver on the promise of its predecessors. The movie is a mindless action-fest that lacks any sense of plot, character development, or originality. The movie follows John Wick, the legendary assassin, as he tries to escape from the wrath of the High Table, a mysterious organization that controls the underworld. Along the way, he faces countless enemies and allies, but none of them have any depth or personality. The fight scenes are repetitive, unrealistic, and boring, and the dialogue is cheesy and clich√©d. The movie tries to be edgy and cool, but it only succeeds in being annoying and headache-inducing. The movie has no tension, no emotion, and no surprises. It is a bland and predictable spectacle that does not respect the intelligence or the taste of the audience. John Wick 4 is a waste of time and money, and a disservice to the fans of the franchise. I give it 2 out of 10 stars.",2
gypsy-87293,"I gave this film 10/10 and it earned every single star. Shot in NYC, Jordan, Japan, and Paris, the film captured the beauty and timelessness of each nations' historical locations. The cinematography is the best I have seen in years. The plot emerges and presents an out for John that will release him from his life on the run. Two hours and forty five minutes later, an ending that brought tears to my eyes, including the post credits scene. There is NO WAY our guy is dead, God help me, there better be another John Wick film or we will riot.

The only downside of the film is Reeves' acting. They are smart to give him a small amount of dialogue, anything beyond those few words is comical. But I, as I'm sure many others, forgive him. John is a man of few words, therefore Keanu was perfect for the role. He has always been the rare A lister that acts his heart out with minimal dialogue, and somehow pulls it off. Let that be a lesson to you kids, if you have charisma but sound like a teenage stoner, you too can succeed.",10
dclarke-28979,The action scenes and fights are like a Hong Kong kung fu played at half speed. Not only are some of the fights slow but seem extremely and embarrassingly choreographed like a slow dance. Very unfortunate. I was really looking forward to watching this instalment. Not sure if the rumours about a fifth show are real. My advice if they are is to quit while they're ahead. The first two shows in the series were very well done. Great plotting and good dialogue. Show three began to fade a bit but was quite entertaining for various reasons. This fourth do not had the higher standards of the previous shows.,4
asfonseca,"I really can't understand how many people thinks its the best ever.

Its not. It was great until arrive to Arc de Triumphe, after this all scenes were way exagerated, he is not a robot, we could never take what he did, while others keep falling of very light hits.

The fall on top of the car and all the stairs scene, competely ridiculous.

In previous movies he killed with two shot (chest and head), now lots of times, in guys without armor, lots of shots completely unecessary.

The blind guy completely ridiculous, its not a Marvel movie with guys with super powers.

As an additional stpe, no way the Table would allow to any of the duel fighters to be touched before getting there, otherwise also John could kill that very poor marquis. No sense at all.

Its a pitty, nice fighting scenes.

And the end, COME ON!!!

Baba Yaga never dies, it disapperas into the mist, until he's needed again.

By far the worst.",4
illmor-814-204784,"I just saw this movie on Imax and have to says that Is really a good movie. A terrific one. Growing from a simple premise but successful in so many aspects. The elegance of the world where this run is taken to a whole new level without losing the charm they put there from previous installments. The action is just priceless , P R I C E L E S S, with sequences that really shine for the originality and the precision of the cuts, many of them quite long. I want to emphasize the original part, as there are some sequences so clever and original that for sure in the future we will be flooded of this fantastic sequences as everybody will try to copy from now on. The star looks more vulnerable but at the same time more invincible than ever and what you expect from his kills is nothing but the best of the franchise. Terrific additions of new characters are welcomed and some of them really steal the show. Do you remember the dogs? Well, they were not forgotten on this one and for sure the bar was raised again. A lot of scenes looks like taken from a graphical novel, so well performed and choreographed that a bow goes to the director. The locations are stunning and is good to see that finally we have another Cameron to do night scenes. All of them so well illuminated. Fantastic. Actions sequences everywhere and all of them exciting and fast paced. The villains are really good and surprising, making this well entertained. Sound is terrific and colors are superb. This must to be seen in big screen. Almost three hours that run like feather in the air. A solid 9/10 for me, i give a 10 to compensate some 2-3 stars that clearly are trolling the rate without a proper reason. If you looking for action, look no further. This is the one, at least until Mission Impossible arrives, and that movie will need to be quite good if want to take from Mr. Wick the title of Action Movie of the year.",10
yogaadithya,"John wick chapter 4 is easily one of the best action movies that you are ever gonna see. Iam a big fan of keanu reeves and after a disappointing matrix ressurections keanu is back with a bang.

The movie's cinematography is so gorgeous and huge that it demands our eyes attention to the screen in every frame. Also the performance of donnie yen and other characters were awesome. The drawbacks to this movie is I didn't feel the villainism in the character of bill skarsgard. He just felt like a dummy villain and his character is easily the weakest one in john wick franchise. And I wished that hiroyuki sanada had gotten more screentime.

The end credits song An eye for an eye by rina sawayama is just so awesome that I binged on it everyday after watching the movie. That song should definitely get nominated for an academy award .",8
vixanned,"John Wick was never known for realism but was always centred around his fight for justice. We rooted for him. Honestly, this outing smothered all of Keanu's charm with his muddied motivation and a ridiculous plot. This film was well directed with great production values. But a blind assassin in an old fashioned, 'pistols at dawn' duel? BLIND??? TOTALLY silly. Characters like the Japanese daughter which went nowhere. Random black guy with dog? The same stuntmen killed again and again ( even in the same clothes). Great flame thrower, bird's eye, computer game action scene. But being run over 20 times and the longest ever ascent of the Sacre Coeur steps. Eugh. Way too long and silly. Bring back Keanu and a clear plot development. This was a disappointment.",4
JTReviewsPlus,"John Wick Chapter 4 ups the ante in everything you have come to expect from a John Wick movie. The action continues to surprise, the cinematography is visually stunning, the world of assassin's is expanded upon brilliantly, and there are interesting new faces to the franchise that are welcome additions.

The variety of weapons, locations, and circumstances John Wick is put through help differentiate Chapter 4 (and even the other sequels) from becoming stale or too repetitive. However, like all the sequels before it, it maintains what makes the franchise so special in the first place. If you are a fan of John Wick you will love this sequel. If you're not a fan then your mind will probably not change.

Chapter 4 will definitely do down as one of the best action movie sequels as well as one of the best movies of 2023. It is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of Keanu Reeves, John Wick, and/or the genre itself.",9
valentinwulf,"As the title says, storywise it has its flaws.

But the action was ""breathtaking"" in every aspect.

The 30 minutes were a bit boring to be honest, so many people have these bullet proof gear that the fights become really weird.

But its all worth it at the end.

I wasnt so sure by some characters which were interesting yes but, if they didnt exist there wouldve been no changes to the story at all.

I recommend not to take everything to closely while watching the action sequences are 90% real and Keanu isnt the youngest anymore.

At some points the muzzle flare or overall cgi usage wasnt on point. Or unneccessary blured backgrounds.",9
globewarmer,"This movie is extraordinarily poor and must have cost a lot of money; the thesps involved look very pleased with their cheques though Reeves maintains a stern demeanour and is the only worthwhile thing to be seen for miles around. Lovers of this stuff call themselves action junkies and feel sated, to judge from their reviews, though why seems to me odd as most of the action looks artificial and almost a piss take of that in previous films. Killing seems to take time as frail humans are shot through the face and thrown across the room but come back begging for the coup de grace. The plot is a simple extension of III, which I quite enjoyed, but there is nothing new here, just old hat stuff, lots of blood spray and the old stuff about a bounty on Wick's head. There is a new villain, however, the Marquis de somewhere or other, and even he isn't very evil, a bit of a dead ringer for macaulay culkin. The script was phoned in by monkeys with typewriters. I hope Mr Mcshane enjoys his well earned retirement.",5
s-crockford,"This film is such a let down, I love the other John Wick films and had been really looking forward to this one but it's so boring, I completely lost interest around a third of the way through and switched it off, then changed my mind and decided to give it another go, made it around half way and completely gave up, I just couldn't continue watching this rubbish. Me and my partner kept looking at each other during the fight scenes, like when's it gonna end. The fight scenes are far too long and tedious, and to have them at the beginning of the film makes you lose interest. I love Keanu but lets be honest he's getting on a bit now and and it's like watching a geriatric perform, his fight scenes are slow and painful - just like the storyline.",1
Sam_Muk,"Just watched the 4th installment of John Wick and what a ride. This movie can be considered the best of John Wick Franchise and rightfully so. Non-Stop action, funny lines, and awesome fight sequences. If you are a fan of John Wick universe you will definitely enjoy this one. Although it is the longest among John Wick movies but i enjoyed every moment of it. It is rare to see in movies that sequels do very good and some time better than the previous installments, but John Wick 4 nailed it. This movie is one of the best action movies i've seen in the recent years and i will definitely watch it again. 10 out of 10.",10
juanpabloroma-1,"Why? Why? Oh, why is this movie so bad. Can't anyone tell Wick 4 has sort of same Matrix plot, but dumbed down? It's almost a scene by scene copy. They even have Lawrence Fishburne do a Morpheus-type character reprise. Oh, why! I want my 3 hours back!!!

I wanted to write a brief comment on this to counterpoint the 3 hours running time of Wick 4. But the system asks me to write 300 more words. It's seems unnecessary, like the 3 hours running time of this movie.

Wick has to kill every enemy at least 5 o 6 times (if not more) during the entire show because they just won't die or have armored suits. And since there's about a million killers out to get him, you may guess why the movie has a running time of 3 hours.

The action it's so ridiculous and unrealistic, that I'm baffled by those who said Wick 4 sets a new bar for action movies. I really hope that's not the case because it'd be the end of the action genre.

Watching Wick 4 you simply have to throw logic of the window, shut off your brain, and maybe take a shot of a numbing agent to be able to put up with all the nonsense.

One hundred peole shooting each other at The Arc de Triomphe with machine guns and what not, and the cars simply keep driving by like it's flies flying by? Really?",2
rocky_53,"Absolutely one of the best examples of fight choreography, (hand to hand, blade, Judo, Gun-Fu) in films in many many years. Without spoiling anything for those that havent seen it yet, it is an action movie masterpiece. From the opening parlay, to the crescendo. Even including what appeared to be a tongue in cheek commercial for a new Taran Tactical Innovations release lol. Sk√§arsg√§ard is stellar at drawing fan heat as the/one of the new bad guy(s). As a huge fan some of the directions of this film and its outcomes leave one to contemplate other entries ideas and/or spin-off opportunities with the loss of one of the best cast members. But, true fans of the Wick series should be more than pleased, I know I was. I was also greatly pleased at the near 3 hour run time, so I wasnt left wanting for material that would require nearly that time, shoved into the usual 90-120 min runtimes to appease to the TikTok generation. Thankfully this fleshed out well and completely. Enjoy folks!",10
vaultoverseer_15,"John Wick is definitely one of the best franchises in history - it was before this movie, but it's gotten even better after this one. The action pieces, the cinematography, the score, the costumes, the guns, the world, it's all there. I don't think I need to go into this review to explain why John Wick movies are good. What I want to explain is why this one is far and away the best one.

The other movies themselves were really good, but things held them back. I gave the first two an 8, for different reasons. The first John Wick was an excellent take on revenge films, but that also held it back by having to do what those movies did. There is less an emphasis on the assassin stuff and more on John Wick's life and people telling him not to get back in etc. It's not a big deal but the movie would much better focusing on other stuff. John Wick 2 did exactly that, but the overall story was just so non existent that I didn't particular care what John Wick was doing. John Wick 3 struck a good balance - i gave it a 9, it was great. The only downside to me was the ending, it just felt like the movie ended exactly where it started, and that the franchise was just going to keep going on and on.

John Wick 4 just outmatches them in every respect. For starters, this has the highest budget i believe, and you can tell. The locations are beautiful, and even small scenes are devoted to well constructed sets or real locations, and it gives the movie a visual intrigue that keeps the viewer engaged even when not that much is happening. And similar to the last movie, I love how we're just fully in this world now. Unlike a lot of these action movies where the movie wants to tell us it's in the real world or silly action world, John Wick sets itself solely in its own world, where people can get cars and shake it off.

And the action - wow. This is nearly a 3 hour movie which I thought is weird for an action movie... then you realise about 2 hours of that is straight action. The action is not paced evenly, it mainly comes out in chunks, there's three big ones which consist of all these different moments and bits, and also lead into other sets and characters. While that has the chance of not working and keeping a consistent pace, or just being mind numbing, in John Wick 4 the action is always varying itself up. I feel like John Wick spends 15 minutes in this glass light room but the movie keeps the camerawork and choreography varied that it feels as though it's not just repeating itself, and also that John has to think of new ways on the fly to get himself out of the fights in a way that is quick and fun. The amount of memorable parts is staggering, and it's what keeps this above the others in my mind. I remember scenes definitely, but i can't remember half an hour of just the most creative, fluid, thrilling action.

And yes, this is the last John Wick. I went into this movie not knowing that, but feeling as though it needed to happen. It really helps this movie, because there's this epic feeling this movie has because of it. Early on it begins to be apparent. Once the hotel blows up, you know that things are probably going to rap up. But how? I didn't know, which was also exciting. In a lot of these movies I know John Wick and the previous characters couldn't die, but here it's less apparent, and they do kill off people.

The thing that got me most in this movie is just how everything has been upgraded, and by that I mean the feel. The most memorable scene to me was the scene in the club after the card game. It's similar to a scene in John Wick 2, but these sorts of gun fights in clubs happen in every movie. What's different is both the scale, and how stylized it is. In John Wick 2 pretty early on everyone gets scared and runs away. Here it isn't until the moment when it's over do people really get scared, and it's almost surreal. Combine that with how the action, while it has rules that make it work, are probably physically inaccurate. I mean bullet proof protection is not that strong. And the amount of water coming out in that party. But it's not silly - the movie dedicates itself to this, and doesn't make jokes despite all the fun its having. That's what John Wick is. It's over the top, but grounded in its world so that you feel engaged in the spectacle. That's why this franchise is great, and it's all exemplified in this movie.",10
Anthony_Kramer,"I must admit, I had a fair share of concerns about John Wick: Chapter Four as the release date slowly approached, but I am happy to report that every ounce of hype you may have heard about this film is warranted, and in some cases, is underselling this film.

There are many new characters we are introduced to in this film, and every single one is such a joy to watch. The standout in this department is Donnie Yen, who is phenomenal as Caine; a standard we've come to expect from such a legend in the industry. And of course, our returning characters are all still delightful in this film.

John Wick: Chapter Four is one of the most ambitious action films I've ever seen in every aspect. The choreography, pacing, cinematography, production design, blocking are all immaculate. This film is the pinnacle of the franchise; a franchise that is rightfully regarded as among the greatest of the genre. There isn't a dull moment, from start to finish.

The runtime may seem daunting initially, but this epic continuation of the narrative truly had me at the edge of my seat with each new sequence. This is the most beautifully shot and choreographed film of the franchise. The film also delivers on the intended emotions throughout. After following John on this journey for four films, we vicariously are as exhausted, triumphant, and fulfilled by the film's conclusion.

Chapter Four rivals not only every recent smash-hit film; stands amongst the greatest action films of all time. Truly, all of the hype is warranted. Why are you even still reading this? Go watch it already!",10
dallverk,"Aside from being too long, too repetitive and too silent(absolute lack of dialogs even from main character) it has some pluses like shooting in the desert, in the club, at the street so you can actually enjoy the picture. If you make a screenshot gallery out of this movie and watch it with a slideshow on your computer with some decent soundtrack you might enjoy even more than a film, actually. The worst part for me is character cast. The villain is Marquis looks lime like freshman student from Germany with big blue eyes for absolute no reason. Orthodox belorussians creepy and violent like some wild island tribe. It got 8,1 rating as I'm writing the review, pretending to be remarkable movie of the decade, it's not.",3
ocmike-09190,"John Wick 44 because once you have seen one, all the rest are pretty much the same. It's sad that this is all Hollywood can come up with. I suppose if you check your brain at the door, you can sit back and enjoy it. But the idea that someone - who isn't a ""superhero"" can endure beatings, gunshots, and getting run over by cars - without missing a beat - is a little too ridiculous for me. The several hundred thugs who are sacrificed are much the same, until the inevitable head shot. I'd say this review contains spoilers, but if you've seen any of the John Wick movies, nothing written here should come as any surprise.",2
kuner-59029,"Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves reinvigorated the action genre, which had largely been replaced by comic book movies, with their 2014 sleeper hit John Wick.

What it lacked in budget it made up for in style and love for the genre. Gone were the horrible shaky cam closeup fight scenes and fast cuts, that had plagued the genre for over a decade, gone were the cartoon physics from comic book movies. John Wick was gritty, realistic, but full of lore and world building and fun little quirks like the stylized subtitles.

The sequels expanded upon the worldbuilding, with part 2 especially being an incredibly beautifully shot film.

After the somewhat weaker 3rd part I wasn't too keen on seeing part 4. How wrong I was! In terms of craftsmanship, production design, visual splendor, photography, choreography and music, it's the best of the series. What a rush.

John Wick 4 is a symphony of violence. Every scene is impeccably lit, be it with moving lamps, fluorescent tubes, stage lights blasting through fog and waterfalls, window blinds casting long shadows and even incendiary bullets splashing the screen with light and color. This movie is beautiful to look at. Every frame looks like it could be a painting. The colors are rich and lively, unlike the ugly, dimly lit, grey muck like modern marvel movies. John Wick 4 is absolutely gorgeous.

As for the action choreography, aside from maybe Mad Max Fury Road or old Hong Kong cinema classics, nothing compares to this. This is on a different level. There's one often mentioned scene where the camera starts at eve level only to eventually give us a bird's eye view of John Wick taking out a bunch of goons with a combat shotgun loaded with incendiary rounds. There are mirrors in various locations, allowing us to view the action from multiple perspectives at the same time. It captures the heart pounding feel of a video game and becomes almost too much to keep track of. It's overwhelming, but in the best way possible.

Speaking of pounding, the soundtrack is mind blowing. The trademark techno / electro tracks by Le Castle Vania are back, and better than ever, but they are mixed with rock and industrial. There's a fun french rendition of ""Paint it Black"" as well. The finale then suddenly has western motifs taken straight from the great Ennio Morricone. None of it matches, but it doesnt matter. It's fun and feels great.

However, by the time the finale rolls on, you feel as tired and exhausted as John Wick himself. Battered by hours of nonstop killing. The kill count is easily in the hundreds here, and this is one of the weaker points of the movie. At some point you become numb to the killing, and the bad guys rarely ever feel scary. They're too easy to kill. It would have been more efficient to have Wick followed by less, but more capable villains, and to have the movie be 40 minutes shorter. Did we really need two action scenes of him going up the same stairway to Sacre Coer? There are moments when the film grinds to a halt during the action scenes. Also, the entire opening act in Japan served little to no narrative purpose aside from setting up the villains. None of the Japanese characters show up in the story afterwards, and it feels more like setting up some kind of spinoff.

The plot makes little sense, but luckily it does pick up towards the end and the finale is great.

Donnie Yen and Ian McShane get the best character arcs. The standout performance is Scott Adkins. You won't recognize him at first, but he plays his role with such glee and spark, overacting just enough and just at the right moments to stay memorable and lighten up an otherwise narratively unimportant scene. His German accent is perfect, almost realistic but with an extra bit of movie villain grit. So much fun. Someone please give this guy some real roles, he's too good to be wasting his talent on direct to streaming low budget junk.

Come to think of it, he would be a fantastic lead for a spin off series set in the same universe.

In summary, aside from a weak overall plot and about 40-60 minutes too long runtime, this is a masterpiece. Along with Die Hard and Mad Max 4, this is probably my favorite action film.

It should have made way more at the box office, but presumably the long runtime hurt it there. Now that it's out on streaming and physical media, that shouldnt discourage anyone from seeing it. If you haven't already, watch this movie. But watch it on the biggest screen you can.",9
Mohamad021,"This is a great movice because; stunts are performed by main character. The stunts does not contain fake feel or unrealistic. Other characters were all committed to their roles and they were not feel NPC or extras. Casting and clothing on point. Location of the movie and lights are all great. Camera work and camera motion were all so well done. Background sound and music perfectly matched the scenes.

The narration of the story makes sense and Overall it is worth a high score because of the completion of many things put together well.

Well done to casts and entire crew.

Highly recommending this movie.",10
mounishyalamarthi,"It's John Wick, what do we expect? I expect REVENGE & ACTION. This part doesn't have either of them. This movie is just following the synopsis of James bond and its movie series. John wick's story is supposed to be about revenge, not playing gaming cards and deciding the winner. The action was too less and the fight choreography was extremely too poor in this part. At least the previous part has some good action sequences even though it doesn't have a story. A nice touch of a gentleman's conversation and nice cinematography. I wish they could have shown us the story of Baba Yaga instead of this cheap story running around a high table for no reason. Wasted part. Could have been a lot better.",6
vishuarora-20785,"Keanu reeves once again proved that he is the one the only greatest action star of this era and amazingly made this franchise is one of the greatest and without our baba yaga , it will always be Incomplete.

I want to praise the director and every one behind this epic masterpiece.

Great screenplay, Vfx are the main highlight of this movie besides Keanu's every action and fight scene, Best music and background score people who made it more amazing by matching the music and adding vibes to it, all the scenes of the movie were so beautiful whether It was snow scenes when Mr. Wick goes to meet Winston or The Duel Challenge meeting with Marquis & What great ending scenic view of sunsets... what beauty man!

John wick is not dead, that is for sure.. it is not easy to kill the perfect baba yaga for anyone. Don't worry , he'll be back.

I also really liked KILLA and hats off to Scott Adkins, what a tremendous job as well as a new character which really deserves spotlight for himself and you all know whom I talking about, Yess ""CAINE"".

LETS WAIT AND HOPE FOR THE BEST FOR JOHN WICK UNIVERSE.

10 ON 10.",10
Victor_Fallon,"The main problem is that the sound design is excrement. They seem to think that 'moar bass, moar loud' is a shortcut to quality. It isn't. It's one of the most acoustically ugly experiences I've ever had.

The rest of the movie is fine. Appropriate acting, interesting sets, creative choreography and decent stuntwork. It has almost no story, relying heavily on pure action. Despite the hefty runtime, it manages to be a lot of fun - a solid entry in a franchise that has been consistently entertaining and consistently high-effort. Apparently this is the 'final' entry. Sure. Sure it is.

Just get a new sound editor next time.",7
DocteurDream,"To start off with, very poor writing/story and the whole movie is stretched for no reason.

In anticipation for this film I had a movie marathon covering the first 3, and I gotta say its been tiring watching the same leg tackle over a million times done in all the films so far.. There are some absolutely ridiculous sequences of shootouts in public places just like the first 3 movies where people are completely oblivious to wtf is happening around them and that just ruins the immersion.

In all fairness, there are a couple of scenes that are definitely fresh. But that's about it.

The whole act with John wick in Tokyo was pure BS, and get this - If you edit out that whole situation in Tokyo the story doesn't change even one bit. Literally has ZERO weight for why it has to be in the film. The stunts in that sequence were definitely off and you can see Keanu struggle in those parts.

The movie does pick up after 01hr:40min mark and is really enjoyable as it gets to the end. Overall a decent film if you got nothing to watch.

John wick - a man of focus, commitment and sheer f##king will - the baba yaga - the one you send to kill the boogeyman - yadayada.. And his kryptonite are a bunch of made up rules. LMFAO.",5
samog-98289,"After watching this at the cinemas in America with my Mum and Dad here's my spoiler-free review of John Wick: Chapter 4! As usual, I'll be talking about my thoughts, what I enjoyed most about this film and my conclusion/rating! Keanu Reeves returns as John Wick & he's fun to watch, Donnie Yen as Caine is Bad A since watching his fight scenes in Rogue One as Chirrut Imwe and now this, Ian McShane as Winston is awesome and even pays tribute to the late great Lance Reddick who sadly passed away from Ischemic heart disease! My favourite part of watching this movie was the action scenes they're so well done & very well choreographed! Overall I enjoyed this more than Shazam! Fury of the Gods that's why I'm giving this an 8/10! There is a post-credit scene at the very end so don't go anywhere until that's finished! ;-)",8
W011y4m5,"""John Wick: Chapter 4""; nearly 3 hours of relentless & increasingly elaborate set pieces (impressively realised & captured on screen by DoP Dan Laustsen in particular - channelling Ridley Scott & Jordan Cronenweth's ""Blade Runner"" in some genuinely awe inspiringly lit, moody, noir sequences), boasting astonishingly inventive fight choreography, cinematography & stunt work, blending practical FX & photorealistic VFX to create a sleek aesthetic that's surprisingly convincing etc. Is admittedly interesting for the first 120 minutes (entertaining with sheer creative ambition), yet by the conclusion, the pace slows to a jarring crawl, the movie veers in to a tedious sense of self indulgence & I gradually came to the realisation that the film had unfortunately begun to out-stay its initial welcome, sticking around long enough for viewers such as myself to start questioning the logic of what they were watching (out of boredom; for instance, where are the police & why are all these bloody massacres across major cities & landmarks not sparking mass reported, international / diplomatic incidents / manhunts?) - which (in & of itself) is therefore far too long - meaning it probably should've been cut down further in the edit, for concision.

However, unlike ""Chapter 3"" (an installment I vehemently disliked, purely because it felt like a vacuous & self congratulatory prelude to the finale, prioritising obligatory world building & expansion without really taking the time to create a self sustaining structure - to justify a widening scope), the latest sequel does finally progress with a strong sense of direction (chickens coming home to roost & seeds sewn finally being harvested), giving the impression as though the plot threads are intertwining with one another & culminating to form one neat bow (tying up loose ends) - but when the entire thematic premise is built upon the need to stress the importance of a plot's narrative ""consequences""... Ironically, this lacks any - so the result feels a tad hollow / insincere.

Using the action as an example; since Chad Stahelski never analyses the impact this gratuitous violence has on innocent bystanders caught up in the crossfire (though conflict's regularly involving or taking place amongst civilians), despite the grandiosity of what we're witnessing, there are very little stakes for us to emotionally invest ourselves in - due to the fact that there seems to be hardly any impact to anything unfolding.

As comparisons, ""007"" or ""Mission Impossible"" (similar franchises which essentially succeed in emulating the same formula - to greater effect; revered assassin / spy jets around the globe to bring down a nefarious organisation) at least have the courtesy to explore the accidental ramifications of their protagonist's behaviours (helping to ground the story in something authentic & real whilst simultaneously challenging the flawed identities of the iconic lead by questioning the moral ambiguity of each individual, seeing how they respond to collateral, demonstrating why the perspective whose eyes we follow things through are ones we should care about etc.), yet this doesn't; John apparently exists in a hermetically sealed bubble, devoid of exterior interaction - where damage is contained solely within the confines of the elusive ""Table"", rendering events as superficial & trivial - when the destructiveness of consecutive clashes serves no discernible purpose - other than for the sake of it.

The literal opposite (& a blatant contradiction) of supposed ""consequences"".

Then there's a secondary reason to disengage; the lack of clear intent driving ""Mr Wick"" forward. Any writer knows that although a fictional creation may not have to be very likeable, they must be relatable or sympathetic in some way, shape or form - to ensure we're somewhat / partially invested in their emotional journey; the method in which a character chooses to react might be perhaps disproportionate (after all, art's entire point is to spark debate from subjectivity & we learn empathy through comprehending choices which don't align with our own) so (to quote ""Dr Manhattan"" in Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"": ""without condoning, or condemning"") I understand... But again, here, there's nothing.

In the first (co-directed by David Leitch), we were presented with a standard (serviceable) revenge flick rationale; his puppy's murdered & considering the sentimental value assigned to the dog, his quest for retribution led to swift & brutal vengeance - whereas here? Comically, the screenplay seems nonethewiser; continually, Keanu Reeves' title role's associates often ask ""to what end?"" & the answer is never actually provided.

Heck, even during one verbal exchange of dialogue, the antagonist subtly states men can be separated in to 3 categories: ""those who have something to live for, those who have something to die for & those who have something to kill for"" before announcing his nemesis (our main guy & the reason for him being an enigma) has ""none of those things""... So being devoid of sufficient motivation to plausibly explain any further development (or any visible carnage), his characterisation feels stilted & one-note, dragged out for the remainder of the run-time, offering no satisfying arc... Simply churning out more of the same, on a larger scale & with less heft, conveying a lot whilst also failing to merely articulate slightly a little.

There's an abundance of glossy style (to compensate) & the ridiculously high quality of it's indisputable... But when the blockbuster is entirely reliant on that - to retain attention? There's far less than it would have you believe.",7
ahmetturknet,"The best John Wick sequel ever. I didn't expect that to be better than I thought. Almost 3 hours of full action with different action styles in different countries. I have always loved this detail in this series and the previous one. Sometimes you couldn't guess what will happen. Must watch it at a theater.

John Wick series has written its own name with gold letters in the movie industry. When it is released digitally, I would like to finish all of them. You can feel the connection between the first and last. Sequel names are given as ""Chapter Two, Chapter Three, Chapter Four"". These are not a joke. Really a four-part full story.",10
jboothmillard,"This fourth film in the franchise was meant to be released a year earlier but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I was shocked when I found out the length of it, but I was always going to see it, being a fan of the previous films. Basically, in New York City, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is hiding underground with the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) and is preparing to exact revenge against the High Table. He travels to Morocco and kills the Elder (George Georgiou), the ""one who sits above the Table"". In response, New York Continental hotel manager Winston (Ian McShane) and his concierge, Charon (Lance Reddick, posthumously), are summoned by the Marquis Vincent de Gramont (Bill Skarsg√•rd), a member of the High Table. De Gramont explains that the High Table has given him unlimited resources to find and kill John Wick. To punish Winston for his failure to assassinate John, De Gramont strips him of his duties as manager, declares him ""excommunicado"", destroys the Continental, and kills Charon. De Gramont then travels to Paris, France and hires blind, retired High Table assassin Caine (Donnie Yen) to kill John, his old friend, threatening to murder Caine's daughter otherwise. John takes refuge at the Osaka Continental, run by his friend Shimazu Koji (Hiroyuki Sanada). De Gramont's right-hand man Chidi (Marko Zaror), backed by High Table assassins and Caine, arrives to investigate the hotel. Shimazu's daughter Akira (Rina Sawayama), the hotel's concierge, evacuates all guests and staff before the High Table ""deconsecrates"" it, igniting a large-scale fight. John fights through numerous armed assassins and ends up in a showdown with Caine. They are interrupted by a bounty hunter who calls himself ""Mr. Nobody"", aka The Tracker (Shamier Anderson). Mr. Nobody changes his mind, determining the contract money for killing John to be insufficient, and helps him to escape. Caine allows a wounded Akira to flee after killing her father. John returns to New York and meets with a vengeful Winston at Charon's gravesite. Winston suggests John should do an old High Table tradition and challenge De Gramont to a duel. Winning would free John of all obligations to the High Table, but he can only request a duel on behalf of a crime family. He travels to the Berlin headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, to request readmission after severing ties with them. John's adoptive sister Katia (Natalia Tena) agrees to his request in exchange for John killing High Table member Killa (Scott Adkins) who murdered her father. John is ambushed by many of Killa's men at his nightclub, but John manages to kill all of them; he manages to eliminate Killa and regain his status. Winston relays John's formal challenge to De Gramont. He requests that if John wins the challenge, the New York Continental be rebuilt, with him reinstated as manager. In Paris, John and De Gramont decide the parameters of their duel, in a meeting moderated by the Table's emissary, Harbinger (Clancy Brown). They decide on duelling pistols at sunrise at Sacr√©-Coeur. De Gramont nominates a reluctant Caine to fight in his place. John and Winston will be executed if neither of them appears on time. The Bowery King arrives in Paris to give John a pistol and a new ballistic (bulletproof) suit. De Gramont intends to prevent John from arriving at the duel in time by placing a $26 million bounty on him, with a pirate radio station DJ (Marie Pierra Kakoma) reporting his movements to all assassins in the area. John fights off hordes of assassins a few miles from the Eiffel Tower on his way to Sacr√©-Coeur. Mr. Nobody is there and negotiates the bounty be increased to $40 million. John continues to kill off more assassins inside a dilapidated building and runs into Mr. Nobody. During their confrontation, John prevents Chidi from killing Mr. Nobody's beloved dog. He is stunned and decides to abandon his pursuit of John and subsequently kills Chidi. John reaches a long staircase that leads to Sacr√©-Coeur, where many killers try to stop him from reaching the top. After numerous kills, John does end up tumbling back down to the bottom, but Caine and Mr. Nobody assist him in traversing back up. They reach the summit just in time for the duel. Harbinger conducts the duel, John and Caine take their paces and inflict serious wounds on each other through two rounds of duelling. The third round comes to a halt when Caine mortally wounds John. Demanding the right to administer the coup de gr√¢ce (""blow of mercy""), De Gramont eagerly swaps places with Caine. However, as he approaches, John reveals he did not fire his third bullet, and shoots and kills an unsuspecting De Gramont. The Harbinger grants Caine and John their freedom from the High Table, and Winston is reinstated. John walks away and collapses on the staircase, reflecting upon his life and being married to his late wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) before peacefully succumbing to his injuries. Sometime later, Winston and the Bowery King stand at John's gravesite where he is buried beside Helen. In a post-credits scene, Caine returns to Paris to reunite with his daughter but is approached by Akira, who pulls out a weapon, wanting vengeance for her father's death. Also starring Sven Marquardt as Klaus, and Andrej Kaminsky as Priest. Reeves remains cool and focused as the former assassin that will not be messed with, Skarsg√•rd is sinister enough as the villain, Adkins in a fat suit is amusing as a supporting villain, and the support of Brown, McShane, Fishburne, and the late Reddick are welcome. The biggest problems I have with this fourth (and possibly final) outing in the series is that it is too long (3 hours 49 minutes), it is very repetitive (the amount of times John falls from a high height and is able to get up and run!!), and I don't know if there was a completely rounded revenge style story. However, I cannot deny that the fights are well choreographed, the body count and violence is high, and the birds eye view building gunfight sequence, the staircase climb, and the final showdown (all three irritatingly two hours later!) are highlights, it is a worthwhile action thriller. Good!",6
Masterno1,"If you love previous John Wicks and have seen the reviews of this one and are excited to see this be prepared to be very dissapointed, this is not only the worst John Wick movie but this is one of the worst movies I've seen in my entire life, this movie had no storyline but it was filled just with fightin scenes that were absudly long and exagerated more than in a superhero movie ( batman, superman ). Characters were like if they were written by a 10 year old and werent interesting at all, scenes were made Ok and cinematography was on point, storyline was the worst, movies was so long so slow and you would know how it ended before even a scene began. I dont know how this movies got this high rating 8.8/10, I wont trust these ratings anymore.",2
derangedxzombie,"Each John Wick movie innovated upon the last and tried to bring new action scenes and choreography to the table. After 3 movies you think they'd be running out of steam, but they manage to up the game again.

Without giving anything away, the pacing is good. The start is pretty relentless, the middle has some story building and the final third goes from one wonderfully shot sequence to the next, it was a joy to watch and so well pulled off - not a single piece of shakey cam in this movie. Just clear, believable performances given by dedicated actors and coordinators. I know months of training goes into these types of sequences, especially from Keeanu who even at a high tier will feel he can improve upon it.

The storyline is fairly decent, we see other talented actors like Hiroyuki Sanada (great with a sword) and Donnie Yen. There's also a big moment story-wise which probably helps set up The Continental (a mini series this autumn) but I won't say anything about this, the viewer will have to watch it.

Overall, a great movie, it doesn't really feel too much like a rehash as brings some new ideas and cinematography to the table. I hope in time we will get more from Keeanu & Chad Stahelski (in whatever form or new IP that may be).",10
mohammadmaydanchisi,"It was a really good action movie.

With a lot of action scenes , but my biggest problem with the movie was that We could not see any injury for 2 hours and 40 minutes. Then we saw 3 injuries on the body of John and still nothing on his face.

In He was in at least one accident with cars, and millions of fights he fell from 220 stairs two times and also fell down from the building onto the car, but he did not get any injury. It was the weakest point of the movie.

It is a long movie but you do not get tired.

I paid $13 on AMC fot it and it is worth it.

John Wick died at the end but I do not believe it.",6
cardsrock,"It's almost unbelievable how this franchise continues to top itself film after film. Just when you think you've seen everything there is to do with action, John Wick: Chapter 4 comes along and flips the entire genre on its head. This is an emotional, propulsive classic that more than justifies its epic runtime.

The set pieces are bigger and better than you've ever seen. It's incredible how much innovative action Stahelski can still conjure up. This series continues its rich tradition of exceptional lore and world building. Combined with some truly beautiful imagery and balletic fight scenes, this fourth film is a joy to behold. No action film utilizes color and atmosphere quite like John Wick, as scene after scene looks like it could be a painting in the Louvre. This legendary film franchise reaches its grand conclusion in epic fashion. It's genuinely sad to see this iconic series come to an end. Or does it?",10
joeymcpee,"This is that franchise that doesn't take itself too seriously and just gives us knuckle-draggers oodles-of and seemingly-endless, well-choreographed fight scenes. Ironically, John Wick is a soft-spoken, sensitive and humble character that would blend into today's world, but somehow he still delivers on meme-statements like ""I will kill all of them."" I think that was how this episode's mission went.

I believe there were 5 long fight scenes and I liked the last one best (without giving anything away). But I can say that by about 3/4 of the way through the audience was laughing and cheering the mayhem.

One can't help but be utterly impressed with Reeves' Wick portrayal. The lack of filming cuts in the excruciatingly long fight sequences, the detail and the believability (in its own not-real-life way) is all testament to the craftsmanship and wll of the cast and directing.

A supremely enjoyable thrill-ride!",10
williamsong-19226,"Great action, love Reeves and Yen. You can feel the brotherhood and bond, so definitely good acting. The whole Osaka scene was great, seamlessly incorporated bow and arrow into the movie, who knows bullet proof suit can't withstand arrows? But if you think about it it could actually make sense. Paris scene was a bit chaotic, to me it felt a bit too blatant. It's supposed to be a secret society. In previous titles when Wick fights off killers it's been mostly discrete, or at least they try if I remember correctly. NOT IN PARIS. Swarm of killers just hunt Wick openly, might as well do it in broad daylight. Kinda break immersion if you ask me. Also, I'm not sure what's the purpose of the existence of Mr. Nobody, it's an interesting character for sure but felt a bit out of place. The writings failed to incorporate him and elevate him to plot significance. The movie would work with or without him, such a pity because I really like the character, he has a lot of potential to be greater. Last but not least, the main antagonist is just some typical spoiled brat, don't get me wrong the acting was on point, but the character himself is kinda boyish and weak, not a charismatic and strong antagonist I hoped for. Overall great action movies, all the cultures, guns, killings, and bonds are intriguing. Giving it a 9/10.",9
buddrobert,"After finishing watching this film, I found myself in a strange place, a place where, for the first time in my life I had envy of a blind man. Yes, Donnie Yen's character has the best of it, even if only for the fact that his character doesn't have to watch this dumpster fire of a so-called ""action movie"". And yes, just like the Fast franchise, you will need to put your brain into idle mode, or better still, turn it all the way off, to the point where you become a mindless, lifeless zombie, if you wish to have any hope of enjoying this movie. And yes, just like Old Yeller the ""Fast"" movies, this action movie needs to be taken round the back of the barn and get a bullet. Oh, If only there were a John Wick out there willing to come along and assassinate this franchise. But, until then, just like Donnie' Yen's character, Cain; do yourselves a favour, volunteer your eyes and spare yourself the pain!",3
dreopdreef,"I loved it, fully packed with next level action scenes. And I really mean NEXT LEVEL ACTION.

However, for me it cannot hold a candle to the original. The whole atmosphere from the original is gone and it was too long for me.

Having said that, I always love Keanu Reeves and this movie is my second favorite from the franchise.

This movie is definitely worth your money, there is not a boring moment in the movie.

Sometimes I wonder how many times a person can get hit by a car and still can get up and fight, but then again.... It is not reality. It is an action movie.

I think this movie sets the bar really high for future movies.",8
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"After an atmospheric and enigmatic opening that successfully builds hype for what's to come, 'John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)' slows down quite significantly while it sets up its key players and prepares to eventually blow your socks off (and rest assured it does eventually blow them off). At almost three hours in length, the picture does feel a little too long for its own good. At the same time, though, there isn't really anything specific that could be cut. I suppose the non-action elements could be tightened up slightly, as the plotting is undeniably a bit loose in the first half and none of the dialogue scenes come close to replicating the sheer awesomeness of those in the original. The story doesn't properly kick in until just under halfway through, actually. That's not to say the initial movement is especially bad in any significant way, just that it's where the pacing is at its least propulsive and is the one area that could've been trimmed slightly. Generally speaking, the narrative is about as successful as that of the third entry, except it has a higher level of thematic resonance and its characters undergo more distinct arcs. Once the plot kicks in proper, it's actually a really satisfying way of driving the action right the way through to the surprisingly poignant finale. In a deft move, the ending opts for suspense over exhilaration and is all the more impressive because of it, providing an edge-of-your-seat thrill that's especially subversive considering the relentless pacing of almost every other set-piece. Speaking of edge-of-your-seat thrills, the final hour of this is an absolute masterpiece. It represents action cinema at its finest, a series of near back-to-back gunfights, car chases, judo throws, dog attacks, stair climbs and tactical reloads. The earlier action is also fantastic, particularly a mid-point club sequence that features the series' most creative kill since the second chapter showed us what a pencil can do in the right hands, but this last movement is a veritably phenomenal slice of pure cinema, astounding in its pulse-pounding choreography and confident construction. The stunts are seriously impressive, and the comedic timings are equally as impeccable. Its sense of irony is what makes it as enjoyable as it is, breaking through the unbridled brutality of its protagonist's tireless kill spree to remind you that this is an intricate dance designed to entertain rather than horrify. It's ridiculous by choice, a gorgeously lit opera of violence that drops your jaw as often as it widens your eyes. The extended set-pieces always manage to last far longer than you expect them to without ever outstaying their welcome, evolving just when they threaten to feel obsolete. The sheer brilliance of it all is almost numbing; it's easy to forget just how amazing even the simplest of it truly is. The first few action scenes aren't as gripping as they potentially could be, primarily because the narrative doesn't take off until the halfway point (as I mentioned before). When everything finally comes together, though, it's absolutely divine. There's stuff here I never thought I'd see on screen, things that make even the most outrageous action of the previous pictures seem certifiably quaint. It's an absolute blast that only gets better the more I think about it. If this really is the end of Mr. Wick's vengeful saga, then it's a heck of a note to go out on.",9
firstbladeonfire,"Seriously?!?! 4 years for this? That was pitiful!

I don't understand the 10/10 or the 9/10 or really anything past a 6. Perhaps my hopes were far to high from watching the other 3 but wow I was let down and in so, so many ways. My dissatisfaction is absolutely raging. Where was the blood thirst?! Where was the rage?! Where was THE John Wick?!

Now, we talk about the ending.

What happened John? The other guy had the same wounds as you did and you died, or did you ""die""? Either way coming out of that movie theater I felt like something was missing and I've come to the conclusion that a lot is missing. Now I'm sad and filled with frustration and not just at the outcome of the movie, but how long I waited for the movie.",4
dking4-1,"I went, I saw, I was indeed captivated. I must add I had the privilege of working with Ian McShane and he is indeed a gentleman and pretty much what we see on the screen. Truly the addition of other characters and old friends created brush strokes of a master. Skarsg√•rd was perfect. 'An arrogant ass!' I always sit in awe the production value and working in the industry always sit to the very end of the credits because without their talent brought to the screen, we'll again that's why they are called 'credits'. Take my advice, sit and watch to the end. It's deserved! Were there unbelievable moments? Of course! That's John Wick! His a 47 regular and and all I can say he looks damn good in that suit.

""John! What have you done!!!!"" And don't mess with anyone's dog, that's my kind of hero!",9
liamshirazi,"John Wick Chapter 4 undoubtedly proves a new wave of action- cinema is arriving. From a small budget to the beginning of a new franchise that has created a Cult following in the youth,JW is a masterpiece original story. Keanu Reeves acting and own stunts creates a new hype in the story. Actors and Actresses like Scott Adkins, Donnie Yen and Shimaza Akira deserve genuine gratitude for acting and doing their own stunts. The Directing, Cinematography and screenplay helps to make JW 4 the best one in the JW franchise yet. Critisism may arrive due to a long, unending dialogue between the secondary characters and less words by John himself. Yet it's action stays undefeated and hope to see more movies like this in the near future.",9
LukasValk,"(SPOILER FREE PART)

It feels like every John Wick movie is a remastered version of a previous one. Better choreography, better fight scenes, better visuals, bigger budged but it's more or less the same movie with the same meh story and the same meh characters. Of course most of us know what a John Wick movie is so no one's surprised here. And if it is exactly what you're expecting than you won't be disappointed.

FIRST, THE GOOD THINGS

Cinematography and production design, especially the colours. The colour palette is beautiful, maybe overdone here and there but most of the time it's just beautiful.

Fight scene choreography is top tier as it was in previous movies and probably even better.

Music is pretty good and in combination with the visuals it creates a really stylish and pleasant to look at movie.

THE NOT SO GOOD THINGS

The characters are kind of cheesy as is the whole story, it's not terrible but it is not memorable.

Also there's this feeling about this movie that the only thing that the creators were focusing on is how to improve action sequences at any cost even if it makes movie completely unrealistic. And I GET IT it is not supposed to be very realistic but at least it should be somewhat believable because sometimes it is so not believable that it's just breaking the immersion where this could be avoided.

The worst part for me was the disconnection between the fight scenes and the surroundings like everything that happens to the characters happens in this fake world. It felt like the everything around the ones involved in the fights is just there to make it look good and make us believe that all of this is happening in the real world and not a movie set but it completely fails at that and feels like like some kind of exhibition of fight choreography.

(SPOILERS BELOW)

Couple of examples :

Heaven and Hell nightclub scene.

People mindlessly dancing and not paying attention to the gun chase that is happening in front of them. Shots were fired, axes were thrown, people were running, fist fighting, bleeding, falling down from deadly heights. Almost nobody cared. I GET IT we are supposed to believe that the music is very loud, people are maybe under influence of alcohol or whatever else but I mean come on shot were fired...

The Place de l'Etoile roundabout shootout.

This scene was very similar to the aforementioned.

Once again the unresponsiveness from the cars around them was very immersion breaking. People were driving around like nothing is happening even though dead bodies should be lying around, multiple people walking and shooting in the middle of extremely busy traffic. Every car in the scene felt like was driven by the NPCs from a video game that have their dedicated route and it doesn't matter if they hit your with a car or not they will continue to go like nothing happened. And the end of the scene they show you the aftermath so you would think that this whole thing had some kind of effect to the traffic but until that point it didn't feel like that at all.

Also the whole fight scene was so unnecessary long just to show some crazy moments were the baddies and John Wick himself was hit by the cars multiple times. At least those moments were indeed impressive. But if the scene was at least a lot shorter it wouldn't be as unbelievable as it was.

And the scene on the stairs...was it really necessary? Did people actually enjoy yet another super long shootout scene where Wick kills yet another 50 bad guys but now on his way up the stairs (twice!) We've seen that already.

And the blind guy...I mean come on he's blind...

All these things that I've mentioned does not make John Wick 4 a bad movie but it is definitely not the best action movie as some wants to claim it may not even be the best overall John Wick movie.

If you can turn off your brain and just enjoy the fight choreography you will probably enjoy it, but it feels like JW4 wants you to turn off your brain the most out of all 4 movies.

All in all the movie wasn't bad, it's a bit too long, too unrealistic and the ending is unsatisfying.",7
parksmj,"Constant action with Mr Reeves in rare form!

From start to finish the storyline is true to the John Wick ! Exactly as you would want.

Doing all those stunts is amazing and fabulous! It's nice to know that the writers stayed with the show. Will probably buy this when it comes out on dvd. So sad that the movie concierge in real life is no longer with us. I hope that sometime in the future there is another version of this, with Mr Reeves of course. As in the Matrix I am excited at the possibilities. Endless dialogue and ideas. Even down the road these John Wick movies will stand up as terrific entertainment.",10
magdalena-29303,"This movie was and always will be awesome.

Fightscenes were amazing and smooth and had long and super atmospheric shots. The dialogue is very well-written and quite poetic and the music hits hard. Dark techno is top G of music. John Wick will always remain one of my favourite characters in any storyline or movie and his epic character has been brought to justice with the john wick movie series. The camera angles in some of the scenes are also super unique and the fighting style of Mr. Wick is iconic as well as the actors that have been picked for the roles. I would rewatch this movie again and again because its amazing.

RIP the legend.

Magnificent.

And RIP to Lance Reddick. The butler and the actor will be missed.",10
xlars,"Rarely have I countered a franchise of movies with so much death/killing as John Wick. Even Rambo can't compete, and I do still remember how shocked people were when they were talking about how many deaths there were in Rambo. (total 322 ), while John Wick through the four first chapter manages to kill 439). Just in case you think this is unbelievable. The Bible tells about one hero killing 800 (approx.) in one day, with a sword), and history informs us about a Croatian killer murdering 1300+ Serbs in one day).

This is far and away the best action of the entire franchise.

The amounts of various weapons are incredible. The same applies to the number of fight-styles, how many speed chases, kinds of vehicles, et all. I kinda like the dog introduced here as well. A Belgian Malinoix, I think (NUTS!) The killings are creative like nothing I have seen before. It is to me very clear the best of all the four movies about John Wick, and I can hardly see how they are going to produce a fifth.

One of the best parts are the in-joke that is served (BOPPERS!) If you are familiar with the film that I refer to, you'd love it too.

At this part of the franchise you should of course be very familiar with what is coming. I was fearing that they wouldn't be able to keep the speed in this movie - and I am, as you see above, not sure they will be able to keep it up for the next instalment.

What else can I say. If you liked chapter 1, 2 and 3, you'll love chapter 4 too.",9
gewoonweglekker,"This review is not made for a popularity contest, something people tend to do to negative reactions about stuff they like, is to portray it on themselves and start lashing out. I didnt expect the movie to score an average 8,3, and I'm sorry, I really didn't like the movie.

I used to love john wick as a series. 1 was the best, 2 was good, 3 was already too much action for me and not as fun. 4 is just on steroids, its got almost no story, its less believable than before, and some of the acting is just so flippin cringe. I left the cinema after paying 20 euros. My opinion is not at all important when you like a 2-hour long fight scene with some cringe conversation. But if you like to watch something with story related content, or something that adds to the world building of the john wick universe, like 1 and 2 did, then I don't recommend the watch.",4
xibal,"I have always been impressed at the quality of the John Wick sequels. Normally sequels get worse with each entry, but this franchise has been able to buck that trend. If anything, this entry is the best of the franchise so far.

There are two fight sequences that absolutely blew my mind and have stuck with me long after the credits rolled.

I've always found John's character and acting stoic, but it fits the character they are trying to write. He's supposed to be a man of few words - his actions speak for him, but I kind of miss the expressiveness Keanu got to portray in the first John Wick movie. Nonetheless, the choreography, music, and action are god tier.

I was impressed by the performances of the whole cast, especially Donny Yen. There are a lot of good quotes throughout the movie, one about friendship that I've taken to heart (""friendship means little if it's only convenient""). I was also surprised by Scott Atkins's character, I was not expecting to see him, but his performance shows he can add nuance and charisma to his character.

This is now my favorite action movie in recent memory.",10
lionranger,This movie is a action cinematic masterpiece Keanu Reeves blew it out of the park with his scintillating performance Chad Stahelski mesmerizes us with his insane action and cinematography John Wick 4 reminded me why i love cinema the magical feeling you get when you eat something special This movie is that feeling and more The world building the characters and the underlying tragedy of one of the greatest characters ever created John Wick Easily the best film in the franchise and what a film it was keeping us on the edge of our seats in the action scenes awing us with its character interactions and last but not least to see this beautiful journey come to an end put tears in my eyes Keanu Reeves was perfect as John Wick a match made in heaven he should win an Oscar for this performance some of my favourite things from the movie were him just walking his Sigma walk in an extreme wide shot in full black suit paralleled by pure white snowy backdrop just perfect.,10
doggen-50672,"Gun-fu is still cool, but nothing new or interesting is added to it. And when the movie barely has any substance outside of gun-fu, it feels really thin. The previous movies in the franchise at the very least brought interesting and new angles in each instance. In this movie, the biggest ""news"" is that another swede is playing the main antagonist. Skarsg√•rd is brilliant, but it's not enough.

The action sequences are amazing, and should bring viewers. But it is not a movie I'd watch again.

Also, when pretty much the first thing that happens is that Charon is killed off, it's pretty much a ""meh"" movie after that.

Pros:
Gun-fu
Bill Skarsg√•rd and. Donnie Yen are fantastic.


Cons:
nothing new, even gun-fu is getting old
no real substance to the story.",4

Go SEE this!

This movie not only builds on the plot, it builds on the fight scenes and the visualization.

ragingbull_2005,"I don't remember having this much fun watching ANY movie, this year.

I had my hopes way way up, as the WoM and the critical / box office reception for this was top notch. It easily leapfrogged all my wildest expectations.

Unquestionably, it is going to spawn rip-offs. We, as viewers, would be lucky if we would be entertained as much as this did.

This is what every action movie aspires to be- full of mind bending, innovative man-on-men sequences, with innumerable kills, on the most prosaic as well as extremely esoteric locations, with its protagonist coming up against opponents that keep on getting tougher.

The action left my jaw agape, at several times.

This sets a new, sky-high bar, that would be difficult for any new action film, to vault over.

Action films don't get any better than this. And definitely not as gorgeous as this. I pity the action movies that will try to replicate John Wick, but will never be able to reach the heights of this franchise.

3 hours fly by so swiftly because of how great this film is! It's one action set-piece after another. And even though it should have felt exhausting, it doesn't, because of how well each of these scenes are executed. Whenever you wonder how they are going to top the action sequence you just witnessed, they surpass it with the very next scene. The top-down shot is my favourite action sequence ever! It can't get any better than that.

It's a joke how beautiful this film looks. The cinematography is exquisite. So many great shots! The Academy can go to hell if they snub this one too like they did with The Batman last time. This is the most beautiful looking action film ever made. Period.

This film has made me want to rewatch all of the other films to really get the full experience of the story as they pick up where each one left off.

I just am fascinated about how much action the on going trilogy works. The action never stop and it feels like we can continue and continue without skipping a beat. I can pick up where I left off and it never seems to end, in a good way. This movie showed some of the best action there ever has been.

The impeccable storytelling, brilliant script, exceptional direction, and breathtaking stunts surpassed all expectations. It's a timeless masterpiece that will never fade.",8
Batman9003,"9/10. I don't know how they did the impossible. Somehow the fourth entry in the John Wick saga is the best one. This movie has no right being as good as it is. Seriously, this film has some of the best action sequences, gun play, hand to hand combat, and practical effects seen in a while. The action/fight sequences are done in long takes, gleefully violent, gracefully over the top, relentless pandemonium, and a complete assault on all the senses. It's pure, unadulterated mayhem and fun.

The cinematography is gorgeous to look at with awesome shots thrown in. Biggest complaint is the movie is a little too long; almost three hours. But that goes by quite quickly even though it just drags in a couple of scenes. The fight choreography is something Jackie Chan would be very of to make. Keanu Reeves does a great job with his fight scenes and he is pushing fifty but acts like he is in his twenties. Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise from ""It"") pulls off a sadistic villain mixed in with great performances from Donnie Yen (his character is blind but still kicks ass) and Shamier Anderson with his beloved mutt.

It's not quite a masterpiece; but delivers a pure, adrenaline filled cinematic experience. The coolest sequence is the birds eye view of the fire dragon breathing shotgun shootout. The stunt team also deserves a big shoutout. Definitely go see this on the big screen and heavily suspend your disbelief. Then sit back and enjoy the frenetic, over the top, blood soaked ride.",9
thehandshake09,"To the best of my knowledge, I've never left a review nor had the desire. Well , Mr. Wick changed that in a little over two hours. Wow is an understatement.

Watch it, stay after the credits, you'll not be disappointed. Rarely see someone make the absolute most of every single frame of film but after twice treating myself to viewings, I can say that's been accomplished !!!!

Even the runtime seemed daunting at first but the pacing is superb and you don't even notice. If I had to absolutely muster up a complaint, my personal one would be the main villain . To be head of the table and know so much, about I'd have pegged him for older.",9
gradyenglish-247-978870,"I'll be honest, I left this movie somewhat disappointed, but I am still leaving a 7-start review anyway. That should tell you how much I both loved and hated this movie at the same time.

The fight choreography is probably the best in a movie I have ever seen. I had already previously felt that way about Parabellum, but this movie eclipsed that by a good margin.

The audio track is absolutely amazing. It's a movie you felt from the very first scene right to the end of the movie. Make sure you go see it in a theater with a good sound system. I can't wait until I can get this movie for my home theater.

Additionally, the movie is visually stunning. Add that to the sound and it is a movie that challenges your senses.

Now, the bad news. The storyline is flat-out lazy. There is no plot or character development in the entire film. They introduced important characters where the backstory seemed important, but they didn't even pay lip service to it. They introduced plot items but never developed them.

Don't get me wrong, I never felt the storyline in any of the John Wick movies were Oscar worthy but, at least, there were interesting characters that you cared about where they came from and what happened to them. In John Wick 4, there was none of that.

Specifically, here are some things that left me disappointed (queue spoilers).

1) In the opening scene they re-introduced the Bowery King who they had set up as a major character in Parabellum but did very little in the way of developing his character and role other than that a 2-minute clip where he is walking in the shadows declaring greatness and then asking John Wick if he is ""ready.""

2) The only thing you see about Wick's refuge and preparation to take on the High Table is him punching a wood board wrapped in rope. Then in the very next scene he is riding a horse in the desert. WTF?

3) They introduce Marquis (Bill Skaarsgard) and nothing about him at all is ever revealed. He has some cool monologues to advance the story but nothing really interesting about him. What a waste of a great talent.

4) They killed off Charon in the early part of the film so Winston didn't have to die. In reality, it didn't serve any purpose because Winston was just a prop in the rest of the film.

5) The past relationships between Wick, Koji, and Caine shaped a lot of the actions of the film but they didn't even spend 5 minutes developing that backstory. They surely could have cut out a few minutes of fight scenes to do that.

6) Akira was a badass in the making and other than the contribution to the assault on the hotel she isn't heard from again until a post credit scene where she all of a sudden mattered again.

7) The last two scenes where Winston ""took Wick home"" followed immediately by a picture of his grave site were lazy. It's setting up a lazy John Wick 5 (if they actually decide to make the film) opening where all of a sudden he was actually alive intro. And if this is the end of the Babba Yaga it is a disappointing outro to an amazing character.

In the end, the move was just 3 hours of fight scenes and virtually no story. That does have its own appeal, however it got repetitive and ultimately left me unsatisfied.",7
sbweightman,"A bullet ballet with lots of overly long action scenes full of complex fight choreography. It looks and plays out just like a videogame - the protagonist defeats an overwhelming number of enemies, shrugs off damage like it is nothing and bystanders either don't exist or act oblivious to the ensuing violence. The setting always required a suspension of belief and realism, but this one with its bullet proof suits and vehicle fight scene was ridiculous. The settings are opulently stylish, the characters are outlandish and the plot is refreshingly simple, but it all felt a bit too silly this time around. Some sequences were entertaining, the support cast and their fluid alliances was good, the ending was rather fitting and although a long film, it didn't feel it.",6
quinnox-1,"The new John Wick movie has a lot of good action scenes, with the first few being the best ones. But overall, the movie lasts a bit too long and overstays its welcome.

Other strengths are good acting in the roles by lead Keanu Reeves (but honestly, as usual - John Wick's character is a bit dull and child-like, and lacks pizazz) Laurence Fishburne returns from previous movies and is a cool cat, and other entertaining performances are newcomer Bill Skarsgard as the young and intelligent but evil Marquis.

My favorite performance though was by Donnie Yen as Caine. I really liked the way they wrote the character, as a sort of bad guy who still holds a conscience, and still has a sense of honor. The actor played this role extremely well, and I thought he definitely was the standout character, as well as the most interesting character and charismatic actor in the movie! Just stunning.

The settings are exotic and beautiful, and the film often is shot as you would see when playing a video game from above, which lends the cartoonish violence to be nicely taken in the appropriate tone.

The big negative is I do think the film lasts too long, and it did get tiresome near the end with too many almost seeming never-ending action scenes. That aside, its a very good entry in the movie series, though falls short of being the best one, in my opinion.",7
SoumikBanerjee1996,"Those who cling to death; live.

Those who cling to life; die.

The John Wick series' third instalment already exceeded and stood tall above the standards of Hollywood action features, but this fourth installment has now gone above and beyond all conceivable boundaries and limitations, redeeming both itself and the series as a whole as one of, if not the best, action blockbusters available.

The movie set unimaginably high standards; it established a benchmark for others to follow and imitate, but I doubt anyone in the distant future will be able to. The fourth chapter of John Wick is stuffed with action and Reeves' uncompromising swagger, and the most surprising aspect is that they never seem to become redundant.

The director, Chad Stahelski, deserves credit for ensuring that the stunts did not become dull or monotonous. The fight scenes are skillfully choreographed, and the camera work captures every move seamlessly. The audience is on the edge of their seats, awaiting the outcome of what occurs next. And believe me, it's easier said than done.

In addition to the nail-biting action and breathtaking style, we have a slew of intriguing new characters (Caine, Marquis, and Tracker, to name a few) who inject much-needed freshness and thrill into the plot! Donnie Yen shone the brightest among them all. As much as I admire Bill Skarsgard and Hiroyuki Sanada, it must be stated unequivocally that Donnie Yen was the indisputable standout, second only to Keanu Reeves, the lead.",9
patbornotb,"I liked to other John Wick movies but this one is the weakest. The action is repetitive and lack the 'humor' of the other movies. I'm not sure what they were trying to do with this movie as they introduced a new female character and I wonder is this to have some kind of spin off or just poor story telling. Such a waste of Keanu Reeves as this could have been so much more rather than the 'cardboard-cut-out' of a more rounded character.

And yes we have all seen this kind of ending before, like a lazy day for the screen writers. Oh! I seen this in another movie we'll used that as the ending, think Gladiator but one hell of a lot weaker.

Keanu Reeves is one of the coolest actors and super good person, maybe he just wanted this to end and do something new, how about a good motorcycle movie now that would be worth seeing.",5
prberg2,Well that was alot of fighting. I will say this movie is pretty pure. It's just nonstop fighting from beginning to end. If that is what you are looking for.. this movie delivers. I really didn't like it as much as some of the previous ones. It just gets so over the top and I start to tune out after awhile. I mean John Wick has skills.. but he basically is just the luckiest guy in the world. People shoot at him and just keep missing him. His bones are made of metal I guess since they never break. I just sort of didn't care after awhile since there were no stakes and he was unstoppable. I had hoped for a little more development with the characters.. and for the villains to be a bit smarter. It was ok.. certainly well shot and looked good. Action was well done.. but that's all you get in this movie. They could have done a little more character development.. or give John a bit more to say or feel. He is like a robot.. just programmed to do one thing. But it is what it is.,6
colin_james_henderson,"If you want to watch this film for the wonderfully woven together story line, your going to be disappointed. There is barely one there. Ok, here's where I struggled. Why bother with a blind assisting. It's just ridiculous (I get the irony in what I'm saying here - it's not like JW is meant to be an accurate retelling of anything). And then it turns out you can call anyone out for a one to one duel and ask for anything you want. Seems like a silly rule to have. The bit where they're deciding the duel - what exactly was the point of those cards they were flipping over? And you could seamlessly mix half the scenes with chapter 3.",5
steveneli,"I compare the feeling to after watching ""Top Gun: Maverick"". You go into the theater knowing you'll probably enjoy the movie because you enjoyed the first ones but you leave utterly shocked by how great the film actually is. It's hands down the best film of the series and it's arguably, in my opinion, one of the greatest action films ever made. The fight scenes, especially the duration of the fight scenes, are just so impressive. The story is great and keeps you engaged despite the longer run time. The world they've created is interesting and original when nothing else is right now. Donnie Yen brings humor to the movie when needed and Keanu Reeves is exactly what you expect and want. A must see!",10
isaacmizrahii,"That the reviews might reflect that this 'chapter' was better than the ones before that i'd watch for...maybe a half hour before either walking out of the theater(one of the benefits of having a monthly subscription to a theater chain. I don't have to sit through a bad movie because i paid for it) or...turning it off. And the reviews were right. I lasted almost forty minutes for this one. I COULD say, 'maybe it's because i'm old', that THAT's why an empty movie like this franchise churns out doesn't appeal to me...and many rave reviewers here wrote about 'the action...the action...the action'. But, as far as I'M concerned, even THAT was ridiculous....unless Wick lives on a lead diet, because in the last scene i watched, where he's on his way out of the Osaka Continental, someone missed him at close range(like 2 feet away, tops?) with an automatic rifle spitting out who KNOWS how many rounds a second? Please. With all the money that's pumped into a movie like this, they SHOULD be able to do better. Yes. The locations were beautifully filmed, hence the two stars. But i really question the mentality of anyone who would want to see this ridiculous excuse for a 'GREAT...the BEST...the absolute BEST' action adventure...by the way...did you like that imitation?",2
pjnuggs,"I'm a huge fan of franchises . From Die hard to Lethal weapon to the Matrix . John Wick takes the cake .

This movie was edge of your seat action mixed in with a brilliant art direction. Each location was presented in a beautiful fashion, I found myself wanting to Visit Paris more and more as the movie went !! I suggest to anyone who hasn't been enthralled in this franchise to strap in and go for a pure adrenaline rush.

The Arc De Triomph scene was masterful, as well as the top down scene through the abandon church while John had Dragonsbreath rounds . You can't give John Wich Incendiary rounds??

beratmirmed,"It has excellent staff and excellent acting.the music and the action scenes are excellent, although the movie is 2 hours and 50 minutes, it continues perfectly fluently without getting boring. It was especially good to drift with the car and shoot the enemies and adjust the camera angle from above. I've never been to a movie a second time, but I can go to this movie a second time.this is what real action movie looks like. I wish laurence fishburne had been in the movie more it would have been better.this movie is just perfect. Like I said, the musics was excellent. Such beautiful musics suits such a beautiful movie.",10
ethanbresnett,"This movie is outrageously relentless. It is a full on barrage on the senses. You'll leave the theatre full of adrenaline and with your ears ringing.

As this franchise is now the gold standard for cinematic action, it seems apt to start with the action set pieces. They are superb and there are so many of them. In fact, this film is basically four half an hour long action sequences with 10 minutes of plot in between each of them. Each of the sequences is brutally shot with creative camera work and extended takes. The stunt work is outrageous. The variety is thrilling. Just when you think an action sequence must be done, it goes on and on and on. Almost to the point of too much but it dances that fine line very well.

As mentioned there isn't an awful lot of plot considering this is a nearly 3 hour movie. A lot happens, but it is mostly played out through action rather than dialogue. Still, it is a well crafted story. It follows from the previous film well and builds out the legend of John Wick world very effectively.

The additions to the cast are all brilliant. Hiroyuki Sanada, Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsgard, Rina Sawayama are all excellent in their roles and each bring something so distinctive and engaging.

As you'd expect based on the last couple of instalments, stylistically this film is a treat. Chad Stahelski is a master of his craft and knows how to present a beautiful film.

Personally I think Chapter 3 is still the best of the franchise, but there really isn't much in it. This latest instalment will have any action directors out there quaking in their boots. How are they going to top this? I doubt they will.",8
gamenva,"Three hours of shooting and little acting makes the fourth film in the Wick franchise terrible bad, but as always fans will keep asking for more. It doesn't have any sense to be able to survive so many shots, running by a car o jumping from a building without a scratch it is not a s√∫per h√©roe movie.

I will have to say that the choreography for all the flighting scenes must have been taken months of rehersal and the soundtrack accompanying these scenes means that torture is not in the whole movie, but the acting is miserable and every fight scene goes long enough to become so repetitive and stretched out that it turns boring.

If you want to see 3 hours of nonsense cinema please watch John Wick 4.",1
rdoyle29,"I have to say that I was a little bit skeptical about a fourth John Wick film. Although I absolutely love the preceding three films, each one increased in scale and added more arcane complexity to the world's mythology. I suspected that this trend had been pushed to it's breaking point.

It seems that Chad Stahelski may have agreed. While ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" does not retreat from the mythology the series has created, it really stops the expansion and returns to a relatively streamlined plot and a manageable set of characters.

It may seem ridiculous to call a three hour film streamlined, but this film more than earns it's run time by creating a series of epic action sequences that are some of the best ever committed to film. These sequences are long ... very very long ... but they are never less than utterly engaging. They tell stories in miniature and are wonderfully tense and dynamic. Honestly, you have to turn to action films made outside of the United States to see action this good.

The rest of the film does not let these sequences down. The plot is fairly simple and moves along rapidly. The new cast members are all great. Bill Skarsg√•rd is a great villain. Donnie Yen demonstrates that he should be in dozens of Hollywood films. Clancy Brown is Clancy Brown ... and don't you forget it. Scott Adkins is ... you have to see the film.

All this and a shout out to ""The Warriors"".",9
jamescartier,"Very good addition to the series. Expanding into the realm of martial arts was a welcomed experience. The story picks up right where Jhn Wick 3 left off. Both old and new characters make help the storyline. John Wick Chapter 4 carries the same level of intensity and action as the previous movies. Though the movie is 2 hours and 49 minutes, John Wick Chapter 4 holds you in your seat from start to end (as usual). Recommendation, use the facilities first and hold it until the movie is over. I left two stars off because I fell John Wick 1 & 2 hold the remaining two stars. John Wick fans will be pleased. Very enjoyable movie.",8
dannylee-78082,"My weekend ended with finishing the final installment of the John Wick series. I must say that I am glad that they decided to go out on a high note. I heard rumors about a 5th one and that would not have been a smart move.

The movie has many weaknesses. I found the story to be quite convoluted when it should have been pretty straightforward. I wish they actually showed people sitting at the High Table. It felt tiring for him to chase a ghost-like group of people with no tangible existence. But at the same time, the elder in the beginning was killed off so easily. Does this organization even matter? I feel like that's a pretty serious offense but they treated him the same as last time with about the same amount of force. Furthermore, the whole ""tracker"" role seemed absolutely pointless. He was not needed in this movie and his ambiguous stand against John Wick confused me throughout. I also found Donnie Yen's role slightly underwhelming. I understand he is blind but sometimes it felt like he didn't have that good of a hearing to compensate how well he could fight. It also made zero sense for them to be put into a duel like that if he's blind... I am suspecting that they purposefully didn't kill each other for the best outcome. John would never miss a shot given his track record. Not to mention that this possibility of the duel just being introduced when I feel like the concept would have ended the series in two movies had it been known to the audience earlier. It also seemed that John was much more invulnerable in this movie. I remember that in the previous movies, he suffered wounds. However, I don't remember him bleeding much up to the final scene. I had to suspend my beliefs many time because whoever came up to him felt so incompetent. Maybe I need to get completely immersed in more to be able to fully experience genres like this.

However, I think visually this film was possibly the peak of action films. It was beautifully shot (the aerial scene was absolute pinnacle of this) with vibrant colors of the underworld. Very impressive shots here and there with the changing lights. I also thought the choreography was improved. They had many creative sequences, especially in Paris with both the Arc de Triomphe and the stairs scene. The movie also showcased recurring motives like underground club fights and crotch-biting dogs. These were some nice moments for the fans and I appreciated being able to pick them out while not being predictable.

While I would have normally not given a movie like this such a high rating, I wanted to commend the decision of killing off John here. Our hero does need to rest here because he's technically free of his obligations (but all it took was one duel!). I appreciated his character arc development over the four movies. He's finally reached a point in his life where he felt like his life was complete because I am sure he could have lived if he tried to as his wounds didn't seem that bad and he's survived worse. He chose to leave his legacy as ""loving husband"" while that was a small fragment of his life. He wanted to continue living to remember his wife but perhaps he wanted to join her side because he is tired of living with the weight of his memories and consequences.

I understand the praise and where it comes from but perhaps I have preferences in genres. As I continue with my reviews, I wanted to be a person that can give equally high scores on the pinnacles of different genres. But I would probably never come back to this series and those movies have to have a ceiling in their ratings.",8
bankofmarquis,"Once a series gets to it's 4th installment - and that installment is NOT a reboot or ""prequel"" - the audience for said series is pretty much settled in. There is a rabid group of movie-going watchers that are looking for the intimate details and Easter Eggs to further their immersion into this world while the rest of the movie going public has probably moved on and, just might, check it out on a whim.

Such is the case with JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 - the 4th installment of the Keanu Reeves led/Chad Stahelski Directed series that is long on style, action, intrigue and mythology while being low on logical plot-lines and...well...daylight.

But this won't matter to the John Wick movie-goer. They are getting more of the same - cartoon violence professionally created by Stahelski and Reeves with plenty of bad guys battling (and losing) to Wick while the mysterious, underground society that Wick has run afoul of tries to take him down.

This insider intrigue will be enriching for the true John Wick fan but will be inconsequential for the casual movie-goer as these plot machinations are just an excuse to line Reeves up against seemingly insurmountable obstacle after seemingly insurmountable obstacle.

And what a journey it is. Starting with a tussle at the Osaka Continental (featuring veteran Martial Artists Hiroki Sanada and Donnie Yen) to a battle in Germany to the final in Paris, JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 is just one, long stylized fight sequence with both Stahelski (the Director and Fight Choreographer) and Reeves (as Wick) showing off their talents in new and interesting ways.

There are way too many fight sequences to mention, but there is one sequence in a building that is shot from on high (reminiscent of watching video game play) that is the most interesting/effective - but they all are a ton of fun.

Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise the Clown in the IT movies) is along as the Marquis (cool name) who is in charge of bringing Wick down. He is joined by the always good Clancy Brown (the voice of Mr. Krabs on Spongebob) on the ""bad guy"" side while Wick regulars Ian McShane, Lawrence Fishburne and the late, great Lance Reddick line up on Wick's side.

It is a fun roller-coaster ride - if a bit long at almost 3 hours (the middle sags a bit) - that will entertain casual fans of action flicks while satisfying the hard-core ""Wick-aphiles"" (if that is a term) with a further peeling back of a layer of this world.

Letter Grade: A-

8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8
christophershobris,"Watching this film is like drinking a fine wine that tastes like a spicy Bloody Mary. The impressive feat of the fourth film of a film franchise being this good is unheard of. Not only is it good, it may be the best one yet. Everything that I loved in the first three films are brought here, but the story and layers is so deep, the characters are legitimately compelling. The stakes keep getting raised, the tension tightens as the films progress. Violence is still just as brutal as the first. I'm feeling emotional towards some of the characters outside of John Wick which means the side characters are really good. And yet all of this began after a foolish child killed Wick's dog. However at this point, it's gone beyond just a revenge tale. Now, it's all about survival, the insurmountable obstacles John Wick has to endure to achieve ultimate redemption and finally peace. That's why these films work, because we are all still routing for Wick to make it through and maybe find solace. With that said, the things that also work have to do with Stahelski's amazing direction for someone who was a stuntman is very impressive. Reeves has embedded this character into his own being so much it's now so iconic for him much like what Indiana Jones did for Harrison Ford. Donnie Yen comes in and steals all the scenes he's in, and a great addition to the Wick franchise, creating even more possibilities of where this can go. Clancy Brown makes a welcomed appearance and make the most of his screen time like the true veteran actor he is. Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne complete the cast of solid side characters and both give great performances in this as well. The only reason why this has an 8/10 is because of the runtime. The other films were short and sweet and were effective without the long runtime. This did feel like it dragged on at parts. Nothing that derailed the whole thing or anything, but broke some of the momentum the film built up but luckily the great scenes brought me right back. I'd also like to pay my condolences to Lance Reddick who passed away way too soon. I will remember him for his great scene in the first John Wick film, and he will be missed.",8
pasikamalainen,"I have to start by saying this movie is not that bad movie, had to give only one star because this is really overrated, when i write this, this movie has 8.6 stars, i think 6 is correct for this movie. So we waited many years to see this movie and what disappointment this was compared to prequels. There was zero emotion in this one, really stupid plot because how the movie ends and the outcome would have been same if he hadn't killed the manager at the start, so when the movie ends you are kind a left with the disappointment feeling that this is why i watched almost three hours this endless repeating action movie, but this is not the worst thing about the movie... Donnie Yen charecter Caine is blind and still shoots in a pistol duel and all bullets hit the target, he magically knows playcards what he has in hand when playing poker and the church staircase scene was laughable, it's like 5 year old boy would have written this movie...fighting scenes are silly, there are many enemies coming everywhere, but still john fight mostly one on one and the others are just goofing around in the background waiting their asses to get kicked. John survives huge drops, hitting by a car and immediatly continue fighting again... prequels had way better action scenes and way better emotional John Wick, this wick seemed like he was lost...",1
aramsdale,"""Somebody give this man a gun""...or twenty!!

The Baba Yaga is back, & he's meaner & more desperate than he was in the previous 3 outings - which means, the action is is turned up to 11.

The fight scenes are even more insane, violent, (but still not as awesome as the brutality in The Raid films...the ultimate action films), & longer than they should be.

There is a very long ""gun-fu"" scene, that is jaw droppingly shot, that is the highlight scene of the franchise, but for me, the rest of the film was not as good, throughout it's very long run time, as the others.

6/10 This one will not be joining the previous 3 on my Blu-Ray action shelf.",6
farmstadtj,"So you know where I'm coming from, the John Wick series is a kinda guilty pleasure for me. The first one impressed me with the Red Circle club's joyful murder-set-to-dance music scene, and I loved the mythic, supernatural world of assassins in the Continental Hotel. In John Wick 2 and John Wick 3, that mythical assassin world got expanded, and I loved it. There were inventive fight scenes that were fun to watch, and these increased with each installment. The dialogue was cryptic but interesting to listen to, and even Wick's briefest opponents during fights had distinctive features to them that made them memorable.

But John Wick 4 is a giant dropoff in quality. The characters are dull (Donnie Yen is a charisma black hole, as well as an african american actor called ""The Tracker"" who cannot act for his life, and is apprently there as a condescending ""he has a dog like John Wick, so you must like him"" ploy) and even Keanu's laconic delivery is lifeless. Natalia Tena is the one bright spot, playing Katia, a Romani leader who brings John back into the fold. The dialogue doesn't have the mystique of 2 or 3, and one wonders about the absence of writers that contributed to 2 and 3. The fight scenes tend to be long and boring, with a horrid final fight scene involving endless stairs and samey opponents, that Wick ends up rolling down to to the bottom of, so he has to do it all over again against more faceless opponents. Briight spots in the action involve a fun ""Frogger"" style action scene in traffic around the Arc Du Triomphe in Paris, and an overhead view of John Wick setting opponents on fire with special incendiary rounds. The previous scene unfortunately re-uses the dance music from the Red Circle action sequence from the first film, so it seems they did not trust the audience to appreciate it without a musical callback to a better scene in a better movie. Speaking of music, the iconic Wick music is almost utterly absent other than the Red Circle Club music aforementioned, and there is no new music that is any way memorable.

The cinematography is monochrome and depressing. It might as well be black and white for the color variation expressed. Gone is the colorful neon look of the first 3, replaced by orange and blue, sunrise and sunset, gold colored interiors, fire lit, or candle-lit interiors. It's visually boring.

As far as plot goes, if you were hanging on the edge of your seat wondering how Winston's betrayal of John in the last movie was going to resolve itself, well, they solve this issue by having a new baddie show up and shoot a fan favorite, Lance Reddick's Charon character, to make us forget Winston's betrayal, because now Wick can focus on killing the new Baddie instead of Winston. Also, if you were impressed by the mysterious Arab lord over the high table, to whom John sacrificed a finger in 3, John knocks him off easily within the first five minutes. Speaking of which, Donnie Yen's character is blind, and it's suggested he sacrificed his eyes the way John did his finger, but with none of the impact of seeing it happen on screen as it did with John in 3.

I don't know why this movie decided to be a cash grab instead of another movie of love and care as it seemed the first 3 were, but it is. It's really odd that this movie is suddenly being praised all over the place, when the first 3 all had mixed reviews. And this one is the worst of the 4 by far.",1
tayangangambar,"Escapism in its finest, of action, martial arts, assault weapons and over the top survival, dominance and destruction. Great directing, acting, pacing, choreography and simple, but effective plot. The lore of the mythical history of the John Wick criminal universe is a well done and told in simplicity to provide enough interest and understanding.

Depending on your mood when you watch this, it may seem a tad too long of a movie, but if you are a fan of this genre, there is enough action to keep you happy.

Sound track is great and there is a music video and stylistic vibe to the filming. As always in a John Wick movie, in most action scenes, John Wick is almost indestructible and ""lucky"". The ensemble of old and new lead actors/characters deliver and synergize well in making their performance engaging and exciting.

After a while you don't really appreciate the stunts because that's the entirety of the film. It was a little too straight forward and had a lot of side plots that never went any where. All that said, cinematographically it was a pretty film. It had some incredible back drops to the chaos. But if you just want an action flick that doesn't require any thought for a couple hours, i'd recommend it. Really as low as the bar is for films these days this isn't that bad.

chrisrafferty-25187,"Don't be fooled by the other reviews praising a film that reflects no appreciation for originality and authentic film making.

Chapters one and two have really been closed off with a load of rubbish for the last 2. Just a money maker now. Shades of the Fast and furious franchise. Poor story line, no purpose, makes no sense and a really pointless conclusion. Rips off the warriors classic with a stupid black American radio host (in the middle of Paris) üôàüòÇ. Extremely poor writing.

Very very poor film. Reeves could dodge bullets in the matrix, then stop them. No need for that here, as every bullet no matter how many or how close seem to miss. I would have thought a crossover with marvel might be on the cards. Considering every person seems to have Vibranium weaved into their suits. üôà

Class fight choreography, props to the stunt team. Except for the occasional henchman who stands there watching Wick kill his colleagues before lifting his gun after 5 seconds, perfect timing for a John wick reversal. Or a kick that somehow causes Wick to fall down 3 flights of stairs. Keane Reeves definitely has a career as a pro football player, the amount of rolling he does down those steps. Got a few laughs out of the crowd. üòÇüòÇ

cknorton-82131,"Overall: 9.27

Pushes the envelope in every regard when it comes to the action genre, and may have raised the genre forever. When seeing an action movie you don't anticipate this level of cinematography, visuals, acting, and ultra-stylized set pieces and locals. Let alone the fight choreography, stunts, and effects work. This movie also invents new open lens tracking sequences with a crane that have never been used and many will try and duplicate in the future as it elicits a brand new audience viewpoint and sensory experience. It lacks a bit in structure, and some scenes might be just a little too long, but that's ticky tacky. This movie is pure fun and continues to the raise the bar, shockingly, for not only the John Wick series but also the action genre itself. Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves deserve all the credit for this.

jordondave-28085,"(2023) John Wick: Chapter 4 ACTION

Co-executive produced and starring Keanu Reeves as the title character, John Wick, as he's attempting to get rid of the bounty that was put on his head. Meanwhile, back in NY, everyone needed to be evacuated from the Continental hotel, after it was revealed that John Wick survived the gun shot when Winston (Ian McShane) shot him off the building at the end of John Wick 3. With a new authoritarian bad guy, Marquis (Bill Skarsg√•rd) taking over the reigns, giving the order to blowing up the hotel, at the same time raising the bounty to have Wick eliminated. And he does this by means of using blackmail, he employs a blind professional killer, named Cain (Donnie Yen) and it's not just because he uses a cane either, but apparently both he and Wick used to have a history with one another. And he orders him to go with Marquis's right hand man, Chidi (Marko Zaror) to fly toward the Continental hotel located in Japan as he found out where Wick is residing, managed by a master swordsman, Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada) and his daughter, Akira (Rina Sawayama) alongside with him.

So far the first one is the best, the third one is the second best and number 4 is a third best, and last is number 2 as the movie has way too much grey.

Spoil In terms of action sequences, there's just as much action as the other John Wick films. The ending however, is the most baffling, as viewers see the grave site with john Wick's name on a tombstone with no indication whether or not he had actually died or not. Both Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) and. Winston (Ian McShane) look over and mumbled. And after the credits, showcases Akira pulling out a knife as if she is attempting to do something, because Cain did kill her dad, and it looked like she was seeking to make amends, while Cain was bringing flowers to his somewhat estranged daughter. Is there going to be a John Wick 5! And great makeup job on Scott Adkins as the killer Killa.",8
khaeid,"Exactly same as the other 3 films, We expected the story to evolve and progress more, but it was just like the others, man to man. Of course, the scenes were very good filmed, very amusing and exciting, watching it in cinema was not a waste of time, but after some time, I felt we are watching same thing as happening in other movies, I don\t want to get into more details, so I don't spoil the movie. The movie definitely worth watching. Maybe I had something in mind about the way the event could evolve, but this is my personal view, my son liked it, it was good father - son time in the cinema. .",5
zizalaye-71068,"!!!!John can kill more than 100 assassins but nobody can touch him , and only 1kick my man felt from the 1st to the last stair . Still watch everything because it's Keanu reeves.

!!! It's like a Video game, fighting in the middle of the street, and cars hitting others but Not John because John Wick is Immortal!!!!

After falling from the second floor My man get up like it's nothing!!!

John Wick: Chapter 4. A 2hr49m film that's 2hr39m too long. I'm pretty good at willingly suspending disbelief, but Wick should have died at least eighteen times in the first ten minutes of this film.

I enjoyed the earlier Wick films, but this is a plotless indulgence that doesn't just border on farcical, it rewrites the dictionary definition.

With a body count of 140, video game choreograph that sees Wick fighting mercenaries off one by one, despite all being there at the same time and having enough firepower to raze a small town, and throughout it all he somehow manages to survive breaking his back at least three times during the action.",5
duhpav,"If you are flying in plane and this is only movie they have and you need to watch it, you will most probaubly ask them to throw you out of plane or to stop showing it. It is insult of a movie. So many bulits was shoot, that i imagine tha factory that produce those fake bulits, is very reach now. On other side, Reeves is to old (58 years) for this kind of a role. He is walking like a old guy, not to mention that he can not run. So, if you are somewhere wher it is cold outside or to hot, and only way to warm yourself or cool down, is to go in cinema and watch this movie, maybe it is better outside.",1
demonblade-37792,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is amazing with its acting, action, and story. The story having to do with the ending of John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019) when John Wick went ex-communicado when Winston shot him off of a balcony, but survived. John Wick must do whatever it takes to talk to the high table into fighting for his freedom to be a free man in Chapter 4.

Overall, I loved every single minute of the story in this film. There was no slow parts at all and the film keeps on letting the viewer thirst for more action until the end. The choreography was amazing with the amount of action and stunts they did in the film. It was glad seeing returning characters such as John Wick (Keanu Reeves), Winston (Ian McShane), Charon (Lance Riddick, R. I. P), and Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne). Loved the new characters as well such as Caine (Donnie Yen) and Bill Skarsgard's character as the main antagonist. They all did phenomenal acting in their roles to make it one of the best, if not, the best John Wick sequel there is. I would recommend to see John Wick: Chapter 4 in theaters because I am going to watch it for a second viewing!",9
Padreviews,"If you've seen John Wick 3 you'll know this doesn't have to do much to be a better film

It achieved that , it's a better film

As an advert for a game it did really well too

Positives were , slick fight scenes , music and sound was top notch .

Negatives far too long there's no excuse for making a film 3 hours long , no film should be longer than 2 hours unless it's a true epic , exceptions are Lawrence of Arabia & Ghandi - those films have a story to tell .

John Wick 1 was brilliant they could have ended up there but if you can make a film for $100m and make $200m then it's clear there will be a John Wick 5 .

If you enjoy films like Blade with Wesley Snipes you'll enjoy this , in fact with all the marvel films around I'm surprised they haven't brought out a Blade 4 with a new actor after the success of Black Panther

Like James Bond's immortality it doesn't matter what you throw at John Wick he's not going to die

Best acting goes to Scott Adkins absolutely superb as Killa in a fat suit I actually thought it was Tom Hardy at first ! This whole scene in the German nightclub was the highlight for me.

It's not a bad film , if this is your genre and you're a die hard ( ironic ) fan of Keanu Reeves ( he's made some amazing films point break being my favourite ) & John Wick I think you'll enjoy it . Just not my cup of tea that's all .

No spoilers as always

Better than John Wick 3

Pad. A 4/10.",4
dmytrvolkov,"While the first movie has serious characters and strong enough motives - franchise was dropping quality with each next movie. This time it's just ridiculous. Blind assassin. Good blind assassin. Characters from Burton's Batman. Astonishingly stupid dialogs. Undying everybody. Keanu Reeves aka superman. Lack of blood and gore for movie with such violence. Bulletproof hands. Bulletproof jackets.

Universe in first movie was intriguing, it was dark, mysterious, but realistic enough. Bad guys were just bad guys, smart and practical. And now it's just neon comics with grotesque cartoonish enemies.

Dialogs weren't a strong part in any of Wick's franchise movie, but here they're are just terrible. Action is good, but way too long. What will we see in next part? New suit with carbon nipples? Wick will rise from his grave? Fall damage off completely?",6
JSingh02,"Wow this is a movie to be watched in theaters on the big screen I would give this a 9.5/10 maybe a 10 after rewatching it again. But what an ending I really loved the trios (Caine, Tracker, and John Wick) they all felt well develop character and very unique and different. And that table scene with the cards was very intense feel with our three main character and the movie whole had the best action scene throughout the series it's up their with John Wick Chaper 1 maybe higher.

Possibly one of the best action movie out there and the best series out there I don't think action are going to be ever the same after this which is a good thing. Caine is my new favorite character his chemistry with John was amazing to see and it really felt like they had a lot of history and It made me really cared for him even though he was try to kill John Wick, his fight scenes were the most interest It suck we won't get a John Wick 5 sequel but please give Caine a sequel he can carry the series on his shoulder easily (just realized there a end credit scene). I wish they showed John Wick abit more before he died.

{Second viewing} The cons that I had aren't significant anymore but I still think the goofy King Pin wanna be fighting scene were odd but again It doesn't take away for the movie I'm glad I rewatched it because I've still thinking about for days after the first time I watched it. I don't get this feeling unless it truly a masterpiece of a movie and I'd recommend everyone to watch it on the big screens. I'm glad they decide not to make a back to back movie but one good one it just goes to show how much they care for the fans and this time they expanded on the story element more and can't forget the action as well. And can't wait for Donnie Yen (Caine) and Rina Sawayama (Akira) spin-off sequel!

Which makes me wonder if he's really died, I think he's alive living in hiding so the agreement with the high table doesn't make them look weak or was a way for John to get out of this business and part of the agreement. And the duel was a private affair so it could be that which way it goes his friend can cover up for him so he can live in peace. Or I'm compleletly wrong who knows?!?!?

R. I. P. Lance Reddick you will be missed!",10
igold-42590,"This film franchise has lost it's imagination, was anybody killed with anything other than a gun, knife, arrow, blade or car..? Maybe that one with the swat helmet, but this is just relentless murdering and the fight scenes look so rehearsed almost back to the 70s bruce lee films where only 1 can attack at a time, and the whole 20min arc du triumph scene was when i went and made a coffee.. the whole film could have been an hour shorter and nobody would have noticed.. the only bit i really did love was the radio station homage to the great great film The Warriors. Just waiting for the spin offs and Nobody 2.",4
ISAK2010,"No spoilers! One of the best franchises ever. They have to make the 5th John Wick movie. It's kind of too long but (it's 2hr and 50 min) but I enjoyed every moment. My favorite scene Is the fighting scene which was filmed in Paris. The movie opened $72M in it's domestic box office which was expected. R. I. P Lance Riddick. I was so sad when I watched him in the movie. I think this is Keanu Reeves best movie even better than The Matrix. It's currently certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes with a score of 92%. I think it will be the best action movie of 2023.

It's worth watching it in theaters. I loved the movie.",10
manojdaya,"I dont have any words to say... Best of any John Wick movie, in fact, best of any action movie ever filmed.. Such adrenalin rush.. All the JW movies kept the promise and this is a bloody masterpiece.

Dedication of Keanu reflects in all the action scenes.

The movie is perfectly timed. All the dialogues, the sequences, the characters and the way movie move ahead filled with chaos, blood bath and loooots of guns. We know john will kill them all, but considering the situation, how the hell he is gonna do that? It's a bloody journey with Wick.

You have to feel it. People, don't miss it.

Hats off to Keanu Reaves... You are the best.... Wondering what people see in DC & Marvel comic movies... This is for men.. not for kids...

Must watch movie.... Damn nice...and finally, We will miss you John..... We really will.",10
hougejoel,"Let me start this off saying that I am a huge fan of this franchise. The first two movies are some of my favorite of all time. The third disappointed me story wise, but the action was incredible. This movie for me was the worst of the 4.

This movie is long yes, but that's not my main problem with the film. Obviously you need to suspend disbelief in these movies but the blind character was a step too far. I do not understand how this guy is shooting people, dodging bullets and not getting shot himself. The movie is also poorly acted, the worst in the franchise in my opinion.

I did not love the story either, the plot line with poker and the man who killed his uncle was insanely weird and poorly done. This world that we have experienced in the last movies has changed so dramatically. Overall heavily disappointed but there was some great action scenes. Also SPOILER:::

John wicks death was well done. A little abrupt but it was time.",6
chestercopperpot-56675,"If you want to see an aging actor move just a bit slower, and his enemies wait to be hit by him, then you're in for a treat! I think audiences are so used to seeing a guy run up to Wick to try and punch him with their gun instead of using it from afar that it no longer looks ridiculous, which it is. Also, apparently, he's bulletproof, and can grab/roll any number of bad guys he wants to.

The movie long climax scene grows old fast as John Wick now has unlimited stamina, can almost never be shot, recovers from all injuries, and is now in God Mode. And as anyone knows, God mode removes any sense of difficulty, suspense, or accomplishment. This movie is a joke. If the protagonist is never in danger, and can never really be hurt, there's no tension or drama. Don't waste your time.",3
theSARTH0NATOR,"üíØ100% MAJOR Spoilers Ahead: I had to buy this movie on Amazon Prime because the tickets were sold out, but I did get to see it on a huge 8K projector, which basically felt like a theater, so I had to watch it again. Anyway, if you're confused with my score, here's where I stand in each category: Story - 10/10 Acting - 10/10 Direction - 10/10 Pacing - 10/10 Visuals - 10/10 Score - 10/10 Resonate - 10/10 Entertainment or Emotion - 30/30 (This could obviously change in the future.) So adding everything up gets to a 100%

Obviously, I think every single category is stellar. From a story perspective, it's very heartfelt and has some lessons in life. Obviously John is trying to get revenge over the high table, but John and other characters in the movie start to question where this path of revenge will take him. His death was done beautifully and got me emotional. Everyone in this movie was shockingly good. Literally, every performance, Donnie Yen stole the show, Ian McShane was incredible, Bill Skarsgard was fantastic and was very threatening, Shamier Anderson was also incredible in this movie. But obviously, Keanu Reeve's gave a stellar performance in this movie. Every scene is choreographed beautifully. Every action scene is even more memorable then the last, and each one is better than incredible. When you get to the final few action scenes, there are some of the greatest of all time. The pacing is fantastic, each act is distinct and different, and none of these scenes feel repetitive. I seriously don't get that complaint. The visuals are the best they have ever been in this franchise, and the visuals for the first one are incredibly underrated. The final battle between Caine and Wick have some of the best visuals I've ever seen. When John is dying in the sunrise, I was and am speechless.

HOW ARE MOVIES THIS GOOD??? The score is as always incredible. I listen to the score for all of these movies all the time. It's one of those scores that just reminds you of how good the movie was. This movie stuck with me for the entire week when I first watched it, and now that I've rewatched it, I can't get it out of my head. It's that good. I've thought about this for a long time, but now I think I'm confident: This movie has the most entertaining action sequences of all time. Literally, I wasn't bored for a SINGLE SECOND! A SEEECCONND!!! I know that term get's thrown around a lot, but here, it's actually true. Literally, from the opening sequence, I was HOOKED. He's practicing his punches, and every punch, and every gunshot echoed across the room, and it provided for the best theater experience I've ever had. There were so many scenes in this movie where I got out of my seat, and wen't NUTS! There is also so much emotion in this movie, especially when you get to the end, my jaw was on the floor, but here, I actually mean it, there were so many scenes where I actually got teary eyed.",10
safayaturrahman,"It is so much attractive for other 3 chapter.

The beauty is on of the places. They were stablish the places were so gorgeously. They give there a raw vives.

Also away in actions. What a mind blowing action they did. The awesomeness in 200 stairs action is also.

Everybody give there best on it.

The movie is not waste any kind of times.

It is so much great full to make this awesome movie.

The climax and the ends is very nice and sad full.

In movie every single moment give gusbamps.

The street fighting is also a insane. And there are also have some funny moments. Everybody enjoy this movie very much.

Thanks to make this movie.",10
Slarkshark,"Unpopular opinion, but this is my least favourite 'John Wick'. It's sequels already began to fall into the trap of having to out do its predecessor. Chapter 4 is no exception and does all but perhaps jump the shark.

The first movie is practically a masterpiece. But with every movie we are shown more and more of this underground assassin society, to the point where you're asking yourself if they are underground at all. You have to almost accept that this world exists in an alternate reality where police simply do not exist, other than of course when it comes to Jimmy attending a noise complaint at the Wick residence in the first movie. John is basically impervious to pain or injury, as shown when falling 4 stories onto a car/pavement and proceeds to shrug it off. And a blind man who is equal to John in both hand to hand and shooting. Donnie doesn't have the Force in this one, or maybe he does, I don't know.

All that being said, I love the fight scenes and the gun culture. The production and the cinematography were great. Loved the top down room clearing scene. That's why I'll always go to watch 'John Wick' and its spinoffs, and even rank it fairly high. It's got huge style and goes all out, even if it arguably goes too far.

As much as I love Keanu Reeves, I believe the way it ended should truly be the end of Wick's story. Sadly, it's the end of Lance Reddick's too.",7
DarkVulcan29,"The way part 3 left off, fans knew more was coming, and the waited chapter 4 does not disappoint, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is still trying to end him from being hunted and in hopes to finally find peace, by going to the highest power, but getting there won't be easy.

Man the action almost never stopes, pretty much there is little time to breath, but that has always been the joy of this series. Keanu Reeves is always at his best here. But everybody here does shine in there own way, even two characters I believe that derserve there own spin off, you'll know them when you see them. I don't want to tell you anymore, but I'll say 4th time is the charm.",10
takosk,"After watching chapter 3 I was worried that chapter 4 was going to go down that same wrong path and be disappointing. But I was wrong and it exceeded my expectations. The positives of this movie are:

The great , unique and fast paced action that is some of the best of any action movie.

The cinematography which is amazing

The locations and landscapes which are the best from any of the previous films

And the great dynamic off all the characters with each other.

The only real problem with this movie that holds it back from being a 10 is that at one point it feels too long long and 15 minutes could be cut.

Other than that I highly recommend this movie.

Also you should watch this at the cinema and not at home because the experience in the cinema is unreal and it can't be replaced.",9
kyla-72302,"If they had cut every action scene in half and cut out most of the dialogue it might have been an okay film.

I did enjoy the choreography with the cars at the Arc de Triomph and the Mr. Nobody character, but other than that this was a real slog. A real slog.

Every line of dialogue was a speech. I can suspend a lot of disbelief for a movie in which every second person on the street is a professional assassin and there are no local police, but could we at least have some realistic dialogue? Nobody talks like this in real life. It's like they were trying hard to have a bunch of lines that people will quote, but it's just vacuous nonsense. And oh my god all the talking scenes went on waaaay too long.

Anyway, I really enjoyed the first John Wick, but each movie has been a little worse than the one before.

I could have watched two Golden Harvest movies in the time I spent watching this.",3
snowadian,"I think someone mixed up some scripts or something, seemingly John Wick is in the Matrix...

Action is top tier, some of the best scenes maybe ever (dragon breath shotgun anyone?). Some of it is lesser than and could've been cut to make this movie a bit more efficient (I love long movies, but only if the length makes sense). I feel like the Osaka scene should've been closer to the end of the movie, it was incredible.

Keanu is more tired looking, nowhere near as sharp as JW1, but still incredible, his only competition is himself.

JW1 was kind of believable, the action was intense, but I could see a top level assassin pulling it off (mostly), with a handful of luck. This John Wick can only be Neo, because this movie defies any possible logic or reason.

Definitely see in theatres, was a great experience, but no sequel has been as good as the original John Wick movie!",8
sakinko,"The first 3 movies were fun. This one is so very bad and boring. I can not believe the rating is so high. None of the first 3 movies deserved 10 but this one was so bad. Wasn not fun, was not exciting, was not deep. It was nothing. I still have to write 350 characters but honestly there is nothing else to say. John wick 4 is a bad boring movie l. And I really hope this was the last one. There is obviously nothing else to do or show or shoot or make. Keanu is a super nice guy and I like him so I hope the movie will make enough cash.

mow-913-138825,"I am a John Wick fan and especially bc of the flowing like fighting scenes. I do have to say that no.4 made it really difficult to go with that flow.the long scene around the arc de Triomphe was fun but too much over the top that made it very unrealistic, when you're John and been hit that much by cars and still standing you become a bit of a Zombie-like person...fictional even.. Joke.. and when everyone is dancing in a club and really no one is reacting at all at the commotion around them, just about at the end everyone is screaming and running (well they started but outside they were just walking around a bit not at all in fear) then at then the scene on the stairs to the Sacre Coeur...noooooo I'm sorry that made it to much of a well stretched almost bored scene. And what's up with that guy with a moustache does he has hundreds of identical siblings?

I really love these movies and Keanu in John Wick but unfortunately they could've made the end much more distinguished than this. I do have to say that the story ended good may he R. I. P.",7
TheBigSick,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is a stunning, action-packed film that delivers on all fronts. The set pieces are fantastic and brilliant, the plot is unpredictable, the cinematography is great, and it is a rare feat that every John Wick sequel is better than its predecessor.

The film picks up right where the third film left off, with John Wick on the run from the High Table. He travels to Japan, France, and Berlin, seeking revenge on those who have wronged him.

The set pieces in John Wick: Chapter 4 are simply breathtaking. There are multiple extended action sequences that will leave you breathless. The film's director, Chad Stahelski, has a gift for staging and choreographing action scenes, and he pulls out all the stops in this film.

The plot of John Wick: Chapter 4 is also very unpredictable. The film is full of twists and turns, and you never know what's going to happen next. This makes the film very exciting to watch.

The cinematography in John Wick: Chapter 4 is also very good. The film is beautifully shot, and the action sequences are framed in a way that makes them even more exciting.

Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is an excellent film. It is a must-see for fans of action movies and Keanu Reeves. If you're looking for a film that will leave you breathless, then this is the film for you.

Here are some of the pros and cons of the movie:

Pros: Fantastic and brilliant set pieces; Unpredictable plot; Great cinematography; Better than its predecessor.

Cons: Some scenes may be too violent for some viewers; The plot can be a bit convoluted at times; The film is quite long.",N/A

anirudhsarma,"Choreography in cinema has long been associated with depiction of story, visual and dance. But for one of the first times this movie has presented a new method of action choreography, this movie will serve as a template of action movies to come for decades.

With a steady camera, constant movement, multiple camera angles, repeated use of body posture just as a ballet dance would, the director and choreographer have been able to merge together gun fight, sword play and human body movement into an amazing masterpiece.

The movie contains no frills no time wasting no fillers no nonsense, the intermission arrives before you know it. You are on the edge of your seat, begging, asking for more, unknowing of what is to come.

The director has used his 20+ years of action direction and experience to culminate into a new genre that has given the much needed action genre a breath of fresh air. Using Karate, taekwondo, gun combat, old school pistol duel, samurai sword duel, god the number of different martial schools used in this 2hrs and 50mins of mind blowing action is a true testament to the directors experience, where he holds no cards to his chest and lays it all on the table.

The earlier John Wick movies were themselves a huge yardstick to measure quality and progress, but this one the director and Mr. Reeves has taken it to the next level. Kudos to everyone who has contributed to making this movie. You have made my day and this movie will be in my heart and mind for a long long time.",10

The results are some of the funniest laughs I've ever had in a movie theater. I want to go watch it again with different friends to see their reactions to some of the most insane action I have ever seen.

For sure, this is movie is only for fans of action movies, as there is very little plot or character development here. It's purely made to be the conclusion of the story, ending not just with a bang but with a BANG!!! It's pure style with enough substances; if it were more John Wick than this it would be grotesque but it's just perfect as it is for what it was set to be. Donnie Yen absolutely steals the show and that's for the best. I had no idea going in that it was 3 hours long and if you just go along for the ride, it never feels like it.",8

This excess is made up of the large number of subplots, never-ending action sequences, and cubed mysticism, not to mention the obvious excess footage in a final cut of 160 minutes. Yes, the movie is entertaining, but in the end it causes you to overdose on everything it offers, because it's simply too much. What's most unfortunate is that the central story gets lost in all this excess and ends up disappearing in a confusing flurry of action.

Let's agree that there are many factors that have improved, such as photography, editing and direction. What has not improved are the performances, the two-dimensionality of the characters, the soundtrack and the visual effects. What remains is the excellent quality of the stuntmen, the good choreography of the fights and the dizzying action, which is the soul of the saga.

I refute those who claim that this film is the best in the series. Parabellum is still on the throne, closely followed by the original movie. Don't even think about the mess that was the second one.

Anyway, it's still recommended for lovers of action and martial arts, but get ready for a long movie, as dictated by the latest movie fashion.",6
yuomo-98641,"The John Wick franchise has never let me down.

The first John Wick film stands out because at that time, no one had ever seen an American action movie pull off some of the sequences that it did. It had a clear and simple story about revenge. You hurt someone and something I loved and now I'm coming after you. The first film is flawless.

The second film took what we already knew of John Wick and what he is capable of and raised the bar a little.

Even though people can't stand Chapter 3, I always thought it did a pretty awesome job in expending on the lore and world surrounding this character. It had phenomenal action sequences and visually, it was beautiful.

In my honest opinion, JW4 is the best entry of this entire franchise. Yes, even better than the original. This film has a near 3 hour run time that never feels like it and that entire time is filled with non-stop action. I find it incredible how these films could continue to pump out jaw-dropping moments four movies in but, yup, they definitely did it here. It's also got a lot of heart. For a movie that absolutely needs no expansion of story to please it's core audience, this movie still had it. The new characters that are introduced are awesome as well. Donnie Yen's Caine is probably my favorite character in all of the films.

This movie has the best action, the best cinematography and the highest stakes of all four movies.

If you haven't seen it yet, please do.

It's action movie perfection.",10
ronaldo_matrix,"From Director Chad Stahelski comes the 4th installment of the long running franchisee which is not showing any sign of slowing down. It's like drinking old wine which just tastes better with age and such is the case with John wick series so far, the current one better than the last one.

Well this time stakes are all time high with the High table hell bent on finishing John wick off once and for all by any means Necessary. But the thing is this time our Protagonist is not being hunted like his last outing but is hunting his way up the table in his pursuit for freedom and getting closure on his wife.

This installment has doubled down on everything be it headcounts, length of the action sequences to the gorgeous Cinematography. The use of different light settings in different world zones of Osaka, Paris, Berling or Newyork is a sight to behold which just ups the ante in every possible way. The use of BGM when any action sequence kicks off simply ignites the adrenaline rush until it keeps you wanting for more in a breathtaking style.

Although I noticed one thing that this part does not offer anything inventive in terms of use of anything in combat sequences but still holds great for the sequences to work. I thought to myself what could they possibly show to top the action sequences shown before in the franchisee but they always find a way to surprise you in the best ways possible.

Seeing Keanu Reeves doing most of the stunts all by himself and the talent involved in making all this work by Chad Stahelski (who himself has been doing great stunts as a stuntman for the past 2 decades) and it shows in his zeal to achieve the best outcome with lesser reliance on the VFX and more on practical effects and using real life locations instead of using green screen half the time as they (Marvel and DC to name a few) normally do.

Well I would sum up by saying that this outing is his best yet and it would be wise for you to watch it on the big screen and not wait for it to come on OTT.",10
rifkysucipta,"I was so excited at the first because there were many good review about this movie.... But, When I watched it....so boring....and really illogical...no story...just hitting and shooting around 2 hours. The first chapter of this movie was a legend...good story and really strong characters,,,,this movie is just bland..and plain..I dont know why people like it...if u like action movie for all day long please watch ninja assassin...that was better action than this...so disappointed and out of my expectation...u fight with the blind and u struggle to shoot him...lol...really dumb...dont waste your time.",1
numinos,"It would be understandable if JW was a terminator(not a human assasain), but as that it is not understandable how can he fall from 4th floor of a building, bend a car and be left without a scratch and perfectly able to walk(and many other simillar situations). Blindman appears to feel where are distant people to shoot but he can not feel where is JW even when he is breathing heavily next to him. 20 people shooting at him (some even wait for their turn) and none of them can hit. In conclusion all the shooters were blind, drunk and drugged or wind have blown the bullets away. Sadly, at the end a man who survived all the impossible things even for a movie dies from superficial wound.",1
DanLawson146,"POSITIVES:

1) I've seen films an hour shorter than this which felt an hour longer. The 169 minute runtime absolutely flies over and that is down to the film never taking its foot off the gas 2) The action scenes are brilliant and are shot incredibly well. In fact, the whole film is shot incredibly well. There are several shots that would look beautiful as a piece of artwork 3) I thought the film did a better job than previous ones in the franchise of connecting on an emotional level and exploring the relationships between the characters. John, Winston and The Bowery King really feel like three lifelong friends here, and the deaths of John and Charon are both very impactful

NEGATIVES:

1) Some of the action scenes do go on for too long. They're very impressive, but they become a bit ridiculously over the top at times 2) Mr Nobody never truly felt like a relevant character to me. He was always just in the background and his resolution with John happens too quickly without the two of them ever properly engaging in combat 3) I rolled my eyes a bit at the two main new characters here, Marquis and Caine. I understand that The High Table is supposed to be a worldwide crime empire, but with every film that goes by in this franchise new members of the Table are introduced, as well as new elite assassins for John to have to defeat. Where have these two characters been in the previous three films? Also, Caine's fight scenes just never properly worked for me and I could never properly believe that a blind assassin would be able to do those things.",8
worldwideconnect,"Mind-blowing action scenes.

This is beautiful violence that's never been done on this level, even down to the finest details.

Anyone who's ever done what he's doing in the movie, like martial arts, guns etc can truly appreciate the realness of everything. Since when have you seen nunchuks used like this in a movie?

The action never gets boring and always keeps you on your toes.

Usually movie quality drops as more are made, it's rare sequels are ever as good as the first but not with John Wick.

Each movie just keeps getting better, they never lost sight what made the movie so great and why people keep coming back for more.

Let's hope the story continues.",10
juliavu-57190,"The only criticism is that it's not gory enough.

This was an amazing movie. There was some slow bits, but it is necessary for the movie.

Donnie Yen here is amazing as Cain and I think, and I mean I really think, the franchise could make a Cain movie as I think he has an amazing story and would love to see what happens to him before he retires. Like a prequel.

If John Wick movie is going to be on a break for 3-4 years or so. We can have Cain coming out in 2 years or so.

Just can't get enough of this film.

All actors did amazing. Some of the action scene was film innovatively with angles not used previously.",10
stephencomey,"Who doesn't like a good revenge movie?

JW1 was fantastic JW2 equally JW3 left you hanging but JW4....... Problem here started with the very first 'battle' scene. Went for ages - Usually a good thing however each engagement was the same as before, hence 'Rinse and Repeat'.

Don't start me on the 'Roundabout scene'.

Good escapism but so repetitive that an almost full Cinema were left with nothing to say at the end.

On a plus, the cinematography was ingenious in parts and a recurring reference to an Australian Bushranger was clever.

Watch it because you watched the other 3, but don't expect Prose... It would be interesting to know Keanu's word count!",6
keltonkhouse,"Now that's what I call the perfect action film and the perfect ending to this consistent franchise that only gained momentum. John Wick: Chapter 4, and the franchise in general, will go down as one of the greatest modern day classics of are time. This franchise has give us some of the most incredible moments put to film in decades with some of most brutal and insane stunts put to screen in a long time. This film does so much right. Starting of strong with the incredibly stacked cast that are all used to their fullest potential, the film stars Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Ian McShane, Bill Skarsg√•rd, Rina Sawayama, Clancy Brown, Shamier Anderson, Laurence Fishburne, Hiroyuki Sanada, and the late Lance Reddick. Reeves once again kills the roles of John Wick. The new comers also kick butt with their roles. Sharsg√•rd and Yen both do incredible jobs as The Marquis and Caine respectively. The cinematography and stunts were orgasmic. The many locations Wicks goes to in this film are shot so well. The Japan, warehouse fight, and the dual sequences were shot with so much depth and precision. The camera did some of the most impressive things I've seen on film. The stunts were brutal and downright impressive at times. Noteable stunts like the Japanese continental fight, the warehouse, and the steps to the church, and many more were, at their core a tribute to the stunt people. The action was immensely great and the writing was on point. The two hour and fifty minute runtime flew by. I'm the end, John Wick: Chapter 4 is the perfect end for the franchise. Wicks story only had one ending as foreshadow and told to us in the past three films. His story comes full circle in this entire and what a gut punch of a circle it is. A must watch!",10
Whiteareview,"Wow, just wow. An absolutely amazing piece of cinema, while realism is on a slight detour, it doesn't detract from the sheer brilliance of the John Wick universe, from start to finish it had me in awe, the lighting, the stages, action, etc. Everything about it was everything a movie should be. There's nothing I can write that could even compare to actually watching it. Exploring more of the world it has built up in the previous entries. Unlike most franchises these days, where more titles come out that gradually gets worse. This is the other end of such a spectrum, it gets better and better with each new entry, always adding something new. The epitome of creativity and cohesion.",10
faruqan,"The fighting scenes are still exciting, the combination of shooting scenes with Keanu Reeves' martial arts is cool as usual, plus there's Donnie Yen who looks really cool in this film. The storyline is actually good, but there are a few things that don't match expectations. The climax of the fourth film is also a bit unfortunate, it's not as exciting as the climax of the third film (Chapter 3 - Parabellum). There are also several characters whose fate is still unclear. It shouldn't be finished in one film in a hurry, but two films can be made so that it gives a clear conclusion for all the characters. That's just my opinion, anyway. Overall, this film is still recommended, especially for those who like the hitman-assassin action genre, you really have to watch it. Hopefully this fourth film will not be the last John Wick film, because I still want to watch Baba Yaga hunting again.",9
toonyjakes,"John Wick came out of nowhere. You have such a simple plot, yet it continued to amplify exponentially. I'd rate the first 3 films a ""10"" but this one was slightly odd.

Don't get me wrong. It has some of the greatest action scenes of all time in it, but there is less action in general when comparing to the previous films. I only had 2 issues with this movie- the first being that the story just seems a little pointless (as if the plot was ever that important anyway.) Secondly it was just more reserved. I understand Keanu has to go through alot of physical strain for these flicks, and that's where I almost felt the same way for him like I do for the ""Jackass"" crew. It's like, you want them to keep going even though you know it potentially may may be as good as it once was. Believe me though, Keanu didn't lose his step at all. I just feel like this was the tamest John Wick.

All in all, you have Keanu side by side with some of the greatest martial artist actors of all time, several unforgettable set peices, and a suitable ending. I can't rank these films but I'd say 1,2, and 3 are tied for me, while this one is just a dash bit off.",8
tpcatoz-90650,"Another addition to the John Wick series and it does not disappoint. I admit, I was kind of weary of the John Wick series after John Wick 3 was alright in my opinion. The action scenes were good and impressive as always but it felt a bit off.

John Wick 4 somehow tops their already impressive and world class stunts and action scenes from the past movies and shows everyone else in Hollywood how it is done. Pistols? Yep. Shotguns with flaming bullets? Yes. Nunchucks? Hell yes. Even a pencil is used to injure a man in this movie. It has everything.

However, is this movie perfect? No. Some of the action scenes go on a little too long, similar to John Wick 3. The scenes are still cool and very enjoyable but a little too much of anything is bad. There was also a few points or even a bunch of points where John should have been badly injured to the point where he should not have been able to move. Example : jumping out a 4-5 story window, landing on a car and getting up 10 seconds later. I thought it was awesome, but even someone as awesome as John Wick isn't just getting up from that.

I also would have liked to see some more background on Mr. Nobody and Caine and more of their stories, but that didn't really take away from the film and it was more of a nitpick by me as to why the movie didn't get a 10/10 from me.

John Wick 4 will go down as one of the best action movies of all time and will be the standard going forward. Hats off to Keanu Reaves and everyone who made this film. They achieved what they set out to do and that was to make a kick-ass action movie. Well done.",9
rope-84546,"I always enjoyed this saga because of its choreography, that was thought and, if not realistic, at least plausible and the theme, with the assassins guilds that had rules and whatnot.

In this movie, that has all been thrown away in favor of more bangbangs: 1. Bulletproof suits, choreography is not necessary anymore as you can just shoot at each other and it simply bounce; 2. Immortal characters: let's forget for a minute about the (useless) shooting and let's focus on John Wick. How many high speed impacts does he sustain? In the (laughable) roundabout scene alone he gets hit by a number of cars, he rolls 250+ steps and he falls from the third floor of a building and the only consequence is hurtng his finger?

3. The assassins: a blind samurai, a black cowboy and a german in a fat foam suit. Is this the beginning of a joke?

4. The ""special forces"": has he really killed all the proper assassins in the previous movie? Because the special forces looks like kids with a gun.

The whole movie was ridiculous and it killed the franchise.",4
jvddaniel,First 15mins were kinda slow but then screenplay took off. One of the best action movies. The stunts were ballistic... a few logical flaws but it's a cult classic for sure. Should have trimmed the running length though. What started with a dog has got a fitting farewell after 4 installments. John and his charisma steals the show. Unexpected performance from Donnie. A benchmark has been set with Cinematography. The aerial shots fight sequence reminded me of GTA 1 and 2. Keanne has done full justice to his role. Worth a watch. Hope the makers would reboot the storyline with a new character in the future.,10
kennethcarlson-89727,"John Wick Chapter 4 is easily the best of the 4 and it isn't even close. Any action scene you could think of is in this movie. Car chase? Check. Club scene? Check. Martial arts? Check. Swords? Check. Guns? Check. Using random items around you? Check. Fighting on a busy street? Check. Fighting up stairs? Check. Everything you love in a John Wick movie is here, and the 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't even seem long. You leave actually wanting a little bit more. They really leaned into the stylized action and did it properly. Eastern, European, and Western action all blend together perfectly and how John Wick adapts to every situation and weapon just shows how amazing he truly is and why he's the Baba Yaga. Yes there are times where you would think ""how are they not dead"", but it's the same with some bad guys too. Just get lost in the action and story, because it tugs at the emotions too and shows you John is just a guy who wants peace but everything keeps bringing him back in.

P. S. How has John Wick never been turned into one of the most amazing games ever?",10
fyousse,"A lot of buzz and great reviews, more than what it is worth.

It's not a terrible movie, John Wick 4 was quite entertaining and had high profile actors that did their part flawlessly but I felt the movie was flat and not as well-written as the first or third. I understand that it is just a movie and to not take the action seriously but I grow tired of the completely unrealistic and at some times, down right asinine choreography. At every action scene, the hench men just stupidly flail around Wick 2 at a time while the other baddies wait behind for their turn, like hello? Realistically, John would be dead within 10 minutes of the movie from a sniper bullet, if the mafia was smart enough to hire one. There was a character who I felt had no purpose in the movie as they had no real effect to the story. This ""tracker"" person kept switching sides between trying to kill and saving John and didn't end up doing anything, poor writing. It just feels as if the majority of the movie was just for show and no substance.",5
Selppin2_,"It amazes me how each subsequent John Wick film not only expands the world building, which keeps it interesting from a story perspective, but also manages to up the action to unbelievable levels. This entry is no exception. And they've not only upped the action of the previous entries in this franchise, but they've singlehandedly outclassed every other movie in the genre at the same time.

Just the three action sets pieces toward the final 90 minutes of the film blow every other film in the genre out of the water. I'm still in awe and headed back to IMAX for a second viewing.

For action fans, believe the hype... it doesn't get any better than this.",10
chloegalley,John Wick chapter 4 is a 2023 action thriller movie followed from chapter 3. Hitman John wick takes his final fight against the higher table. Nothing compares to the first and second John wick now there were excellent. When watching this movie in London me and my friend said it was good but the storyline was very weak In fact it didn't really have much of one. The movie was crammed with fighting and no storyline it was disappointing in places. Keanu Reeves is very good but does not say hardly anything in the film which is rather strange. It's not his best was far to hyped up it's certainly no 10/10. Although did enjoy it certainly won't watch it again.,7

Since this is the last chapter, perfect ending! I can't say anything bad, Keanu performance is also the best ever! The lights during the whole movie creates an unique atmosphere with a bit of steampunk effect. I hope this will be the new standard of any action movie, this is how filming should look like! I don't remember the last time when did I feel after a cinema that my money was well spent, but this ticket worth it so much! Best ever action movie with beautiful scenes and music! Thrilling!",10
incredinleone,"It was an ENORMOUS let down. Story ""edited"" many major aspects of the first 3 just so they could make a 4th for $. Much much more of the stupid bulletproof 3 piece suits where no one has massive blunt force trauma from repeated hits. Needlessly added a new potential future dog handler just to continue the series. Another bounty where John is attacked across a major city by the hundreds of unknown bad guys with zero police presence. Just drivel !!!

alnowaiseraziz-68576,"The review can be shortened in one way, which is action. When you wait for several years to get the excitement you need from action movies, especially since there is no action movie that fulfills the purpose except for John Wick, here he is now to fulfill what you wish for, a movie that you may get tired of action and satisfy your instinct for several years to come.

Great actor, an exciting and interesting story that you will not regret that you entered to watch, can't wait to see John Wick chapter five. Now I have to fast from action movies until 2024 So i can enjoy what is coming to shake the throne of action movies again.",7
garethwooduk,"With every new passing John Wick movie we generally now have an idea what to expect, this movie continues a very similar format like previous but cinematography is spot on, action sequences heightened, set pieces are more vivid and a plot that sees Mr Wick running out of time.

Plot was good, a continuation with the stakes heightened and the higher table hell bent on bringing John down with added help at play.

Pace of this movie is really good, never lagging and action well balanced with old and new cast playing their part.

These movies work because they push the boundaries by upping the anti with glorious visuals with this being inspired by Samurai movies it has a real artistic feel and brilliant in IMAX!",8
talbotphoto,"Feels like a high production fan fiction, or perhaps someone from the High Table (if you know what I mean) sampled the social media and compiled fan's favorite bits into this mishmash of a movie.

Very little rhyme or reason to it... All plot lines feel calculated and unnatural, as if it was directed by a spreadsheet (or an AI perhaps?) and not a real person.

And the ending... Good grief! I can almost hear the boardroom discussing how to make this movie end in such a way that it will provoke strong social media reactions, possibly igniting sequels and spinoffs. And while at it, likely boost DVD sales due to included alternative endings.

I find it very interesting that he incorporates his characters being blind which adds an extra added upmh to his presentation. I like very much the fight scenes that didn't involve Wick. It added tonthe film and helped to expand the Wick Universe. Thank you for introducing Mr. Nobody & his ""Comfort K-9"".

This one was just way too long and it's just insanely unplausible that any one armed man is going to drop hundreds and hundreds of assassins, even when huge groups of them all have a clear shot and yet most just wait their turn, like old kung fu movies from the 70s. Come on. There's so much non-stop fighting that it gets boring and you just wish they had put more effort into telling a story, building up characters more and building suspense and anticipation. Nope, shooting, shooting, punch, stab, boom, slash, shooting, boom, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat and repeat. Wait, is there going to be a shocking twist? Oooo, nope. Repeat, repeat, repeat and repeat annnnnnnd, the end.",6
outrunkid,"I was a big fan of the first John Wick film when it first came out - it was so revolutionary in its cinematography, style and choreography of its fight scenes. The second John Wick I found escalated everything that was brilliant about the first one and simply made it all better - better longer fight scenes, better character development and better direction. Then came number three which I was really quite disappointed with. I found the pacing so uncomfortable - there was so much action, so much nonsense on screen that I felt the franchise had lost its way.

But today I saw chapter 4 - the best way I can describe it it is that it is a strange mix between chapter 2 and chapter 3 but my god does it work. The action, direction and choreography and stunt work on display here has simply never been seen like this in an action movie before. I think I can confidently say that it is the best of the sequels.

Bill sarsgaard is simply magnificent as the new villain, most of the new characters introduced add depth to the world and it seems to me that the series has come full circle to finally find a place where it belongs - larger than life action with sometimes even sincere character moments and a solidly paced story.

There are so many fantastic actions sequences here that it is hard to describe how enthralling and how fun they are but rest assured if you are even the slightest fan of action films you will absolutely love John Wick chapter 4.

By the way... Maybe after this you might want to check out Hotline Miami... Just saying üòâ",9
No-Life-101,"[P. S There's a post credit scene!]

I can honestly say that Chapter 4 is amazing and might be one of the best movies from this series! The action is really engaging (like the other films), and it looks realistic too, the action scenes take up a lot of the movie but that's just the essence of John Wick and it only adds to the tension and story.

Speaking of the story, it's easy to follow and understand, at times it did get emotional but still allowed for some humorous moments that made the audience laugh, and a pretty heart-warming ending. The characters are all very likeable and unlikable (in the sense that you're meant to dislike the character) and the actors played them very well!

Other details: > Uses lots of shadows in scenes that it became predictable, but I still liked it.

> Costumes/clothing looked really nice throughout the film > Music is very immersive and adds more tension to the scenes, it also keeps the audience engaged and makes the scenes more entertaining > I also noticed that there's a lot of scenes where a character is walking for some time, so we just get to hear their footsteps.",9
jared-25331,"This was my most anticipated movie of 2023, & John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) both lived up & exceed all of my expectations. John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) is not only the best movie of 2023, not only is it the best movie of the John Wick Franchise, but it is one of the greatest Action Movies of all time & is possibly the greatest movie that Keanu Reeves has ever done in his career.

The action & violence is outstandingly phenomenal! There are so many phenomenal standout action scenes, that I can't name all of them. One of my favorite scenes is where they are paying homage to Cowboy Bebop.

So if I didn't sell you enough with those statements, John Wick; Chapter 4 (2023) is a masterpiece of the action genre. It is the best movie of 2023 & I believe that no movie will even come close to besting it for the rest of the year!",10
ryanpersaud-59415,"John Wick has been one of the most surprising stories of the past decade; a franchise that has basically become a genre of its own, one with a rabid and growing cult following, that revived beloved actor Keanu Reeves' career and upped the ante for action in American cinema.

So it does pain me a bit to admit that I didn't really like John Wick: Chapter 4 as nearly as much as I thought I would. To be honest, at this point, the franchise feels a bit tired.

I get that these movies aren't really about the plot, but the extended universe around Wick is what makes them interesting and it's been like that from the start. Take away the shadowy underground world of the assassins, and the first movie is a generic revenge film with great action sequences. Every instalment since then has upped the ante and introduced new stuff to flesh out this world. This movie seems to plateau a bit in that regard.

That being said, there is a lot to like in Chapter 4. We're introduced to new - and admittedly fun - characters like Donnie Yen's Caine and Shamier Anderson's ""Hunter - and awesome locations: from Osaka to Berlin to Paris. There are some truly incredible action sequences here: the whole Berlin club scene is - Chef's Kiss - exquisite and highlights the best thing most of these movies do: give us fantastic nightclub fight scenes. The overheard, extended one take in the building, with John shooting incendiary shotgun rounds is absolutely incredible and the best scene of the film, in my opinion. The staircase scene is a great, fun, and truly ludicrous sequence, one that is so unrealistic, you can't help but laugh.

However, on the plot side of things, John Wick has never felt more like a video game, with literal mini bosses punctuating the various ""levels"" of the movie. I never really felt emotionally invested, knowing that John can take literally any amount of damage and his plot armour will protect him. It's that lack of tension that was first a feature, and now feels like a bug.

Speaking of Mr. Wick, I have to say, Keanu Reeves was pretty bad in this movie. Not in terms of his stunt performance or the physicality, but literally in terms of his acting. I know this is not a popular take, I know he has a certain way of acting in these movies, I'm not dumb. But, I can't help but feel he doesn't really know what tone he's supposed to be hitting with his (very few) lines in this movie.

But, he's not the worst actor. That would have to go to Bill Skarsg√•rd, whose ""French"" character - Marquis Vincent de Gramont (real name) - has perhaps the worst, most unconvincing, annoying accent I have heard in a LONG TIME. Why they couldn't just hire a French actor is beyond me; Jean Reno should've played this character, we all know it. He's not just an unconvincing villain, but a bafflingly stupid one at that.

By the end of Chapter 4, I was exhausted. I like this franchise, but I can't help but feel it probably peaked with 2 and has been on diminishing returns since. The legacy is there, it's good to know when to end.",6
glaneljhonathan,"This movie stands upto its genre more than any movie ever has. We see minimum dialogue and more action that not only looks organic, and sometimes even hilarious, but also very memorable, engrossing, and satisfying until the nth minute.

All the actors did a great job performing the stunts. The same cannot be said about the sometimes goofy acting and the D&D universe-like dialogues. They knew what they were doing.

Definitely missed some key characters. And some changes were obviously made due to real life death of the Concierge.

Overall, I loved it, and couldn't look one second away from the screen. Wish the final scene was better written though; but still this one leaves options more open for the future of John Wick's character, while also giving a fitting end if in case sequels wouldn't be made.

Sequel to that or not, there are thankfully atleast some other stories being set up in the franchise as revealed by the post credits and others by news. So we're definitely not done, & we'll be seeing more soon.",10
janniktheninja,"Keanu Reeves returns as the titular character, John Wick, an ex-assassin on the run after breaking the Continental's rules. The movie begins where the previous one left off, with John Wick escaping New York City and fleeing to Russia. As he tries to outrun his past and the many enemies he's made, he finds himself caught in a web of political intrigue and deception that threatens to destroy everything he holds dear.

The plot of John Wick 4 is intricately crafted, with many twists and turns that keep the audience engaged from start to finish. Director Chad Stahelski has done an excellent job of maintaining the franchise's trademark style while also adding new elements that make the movie feel fresh and exciting.

One of the most impressive things about John Wick 4 is its action sequences. The fight scenes are fast-paced, intense, and expertly choreographed. From hand-to-hand combat to gun battles, the movie never fails to deliver heart-pumping action that leaves the audience on the edge of their seats.

Keanu Reeves' performance as John Wick is outstanding, as always. He effortlessly embodies the character's stoic and determined persona, making the audience root for him every step of the way. The supporting cast is also exceptional, with actors like Laurence Fishburne and Ian McShane adding depth and complexity to their respective roles.

The movie's visuals are stunning, with the cinematography capturing the grit and glamour of the various locations in which the movie takes place. From the neon-lit streets of Tokyo to the icy wilderness of Siberia, every scene is beautifully shot and expertly crafted.

Overall, John Wick 4 is an exceptional addition to the franchise, offering fans everything they love about the previous movies while also adding new elements that make it feel fresh and exciting. With its stunning visuals, heart-pumping action, and outstanding performances, this movie is a must-see for any action movie fan. Chad Stahelski and the entire cast and crew have done an excellent job, and I cannot recommend this movie enough.",10
thorntoncleveleysfc,"Ruined the Franchise John Wick Class John Wick 2 Good Film John Wick 3 pointless John Wick 4 absolute pants.

Loved the first Film.

Was full of great fight scenes and was over the top but believable This film was hard to watch at times Had characters come out of nowhere and their relevance not really explained Could have made up for the pointless ep 3

Once this had finished had to watch original again so I wouldn't begin to hate it.

The acting wasn't the problem just the storyline The chase in France as well was ridiculously stupid.

Wouldn't recommend to anyone it might taint your love of the original.",1
pete-murphy97,"John Wick Chapter 4 is a nonsensical blast. It's almost three hours of an unbroken chain of jaw-droppingly silly fight scenes that do amount to some entertainment; but fall a fair distance short of coherent storytelling.

This is Keanu Reeves indulging in Jackie Chan fight scene fantasies, minus the legendary martial arts extravaganza of Chan. Instead, Wick presents more of a Chuck Norris or Schwarzenegger brute force; he's all bite no bark, letting out the occasional ""Yeah,"" to affirm his next killing spree as a one-man army.

And the onslaught really rarely stops for a breather. You could go out for a piss, make a sandwich, do a shopping run and return to quite probably the same fight scene. It's like being waterboarded with the same relentless ""dodge, reload mag, headshot"" sequence.

Wick really miraculously dodges a million bullets (a Matrix throwback?), and finds himself fighting, incidentally, in a succession of stunning locations across Paris - where the gendarmerie is nowhere to be seen. But maybe that's a string-pull of The High Table? The film seldom explains itself. Oftentimes, in other areas we see robotic extras as unreactive crowds (nightclub scene). In general, the city doesn't feel like a city, rather a playground for well, John Wick & co. It could be lifted from Grand Theft Auto with how shallow the French metropolis feels here.

The Le Chiffre-style crime boss, the ""Marchese"" (Bill Skarsg√•rd) gives spades of unlikeable sartorial snobbery that's easy to rally against behind the absolute battering ram in John Wick. But the interplay between the characters doesn't amount to much more than grunts, braggadocio, wry smiles, and ""I'm gonna kill you, mate.""

There are other characters too, sidelined by Wick but there on the fringe as sort of cheerleaders. Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), Winston (Ian McShane), and Caine (Donnie Yen) are memorable, but sort of just ""there"".

By now, four instalments in, and with lackluster closure, the candle really has burned to the wick. The series shouldn't continue to be the cash cow that it currently is but will probably continue to be.

6.2/10.",6
ManrajJubal,"We all know what John Wick movies are all about...fight, action, music, fight, action and then more fight and action. And yeah, some words in between.

Yet not a single time, you would feel bored or say...oh enuf of fighting...coz it just keeps getting more creative and insane.

After the library/museum fight scene in Chapter 3, I was wondering how the hell would they meet my expectations. Though that scene still tops my list, this movie did come up with so many kick-ass fighting sequences and brilliant action ideas that kept me on the edge of my seat. No one cannot appreciate them. That's a sure thing.

Note - they used the exact same framework as in the earlier parts - tempo, music, minimal words, dogs, guns, knives, more guns, cars, bikes...but it works, as in each part even though the formula was same, they bought novelty in its execution and the action layout.

Just keep in mind that John Wick does not break bones, might well have ""Vibranium"" inside.

Rest all is boom, bang and fun! As Winston might have put it... Movie is such""",10
steveo122,"Eventually I'll see the whole thing but I've turned it off four times already before it's halfway through because they won't stop sounding stupid when they talk and turning it up to 11 means they think they have to talk more while stunt people dance and twitch around waiting to be killed/maimed in 'look what we can do' set-ups that turn the wick/high table world of mystery into a ridiculously lethal episode of ""Wipeout"" and curiously leading at least to a better class of tedium.... 'They' did the same thing with the road warrior franchise by turning Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome up to an over-the-top 11.

The last sentence added to meet the 600 character requirement which is imdb's way of telling me they don't need my input anymore.",7
gehriquentin,"So first of all, I was not really excited to see this movie because seeing John Wick being immortal is cool but not plausible.

What I liked from the movie :

The bad guy was cool and I love the actor that played him

The blind assassin thing was a good idea with some good scenes like when he put some devices that make sound when people pass by so he know when to shoot

In general, even if not plausible the action was beautiful and well put together (that's why I watch John Wick at first)

Things that I didn't like :

The poker game because I didn't understand the plan of the guy that cheat he is like ¬´ I cheated ¬ª when he show his cards, it's dumb of course they were going to try to kill you or at least John I'd going to try (and success) so that don't make sense maybe he wanted to ran away with the distraction

The duel because the twist that John did not shoot so he can still shoot on the bad got me confused, they should have explain the rules

All the moments where a normal human being is suppose to die but John don't and just get up normally after 30 seconds on the floor, it was really too much in comparison of the other movies

So in conclusion, I had good time watching the fight sequence but it's all the scenario wasn't good.",6
rallzom_begisson,"After so many unnecessary movies and series that flattered all segments that did everything for the sake of being watched, you really came out very good. THX!!!

It was really exciting I didn't understand when the 2.50 hours had passed, a few scenes were really, really exciting, I'm tired of making movies just for those segments where things are really constantly shown, it feels so good to watch a real action movie.

Some of the actors come across characters that we never expected and do their job successfully, giving unexpected performances.

I left the hall with a smile on my face and in a fun way, thanks to everyone who contributed to this film.",10

I'll say it again: It was non stop shooting for 2 and a half hours. Like actually no plot at all. The other movies, there was character development, something at stake. I actually can't believe that they spent 30 million making this. I actually created an IMBD account just to I could write a review.

Cinema-reviewer321,"The first John Wick (2014) was a particularly good action that worked with a simple premise, and John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) and John Wick Chapter 3-Parabellum (2019) were both good sequels close to being as good as the first. After watching John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023), I would say this is the best entry in the John Wick franchise.

Keanu Reeves was spectacular as John Wick; you can tell how angry he is since the ending of the last movie, and he was awesome in the fantastic action sequences. The whole cast in the movie was fantastic in action scenes each killing people in many ways, especially Donnie Yen as Caine and Tracker played by Shamier Anderson. Caine was a blind man who was cool in fight sequences, and he had a friendship with John Wick that was believable and heartwarming when they bonded, along with Tracker being cool and having a cute killer dog with him.

The action sequences were amazing to watch; they had beautiful long takes, wide shots, and occasional overhead shots. Multiple weapons are used like guns, knives, katanas, nunchucks, etc. The locations these action sequences take place in were fantastic and nicely shot with occasional pretty shots of the locations. The camera work in these action sequences was great to watch how smooth the camera moved around the actors either in fist fights, gun fights, blade fights, or action scenes with the characters driving around in cars.

Great cinematography with a lot of pretty camera shots, and a lot of action sequences that stand out with great stunt work like an action scene on long sets of stairs in Paris or in the big third act. The ending will have a lot of people talking about it for a while, but I thought it was a nice ending for the character of John Wick and thought it was also a nice ending for these John Wick movies, until they make spinoffs on certain interesting characters or a prequel.

John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) was the best entry in the franchise and was better than the first movie John Wick (2014). Amazing action, great acting from Keanu Reeves and others, Bill Skarsgard was an exceptionally good villain, and all the characters were remarkably interesting in how they connect with John Wick. I thought this was a nice ending to the character, and I highly recommend watching this movie if you have seen the earlier three entries in this cool and fun action franchise.",8
kalaltejas,"BABA YAGA IS GOD, PARDON ME, GOD IS BABA YAGA"" Never watched previous installment of John Wick although the character catches your eyes at very instant as appear on the screen, the story couldn't be better if the characters didn't give justice to their part all in all a MUST watch Movie. The German Sphered has stand alone performance along with Keanu Reeves, Donie Yen, Scott Adkins, Bill Skarsg√•rd, Ian Macshan, Lauren Fishburne, Hiroyuki Sanada. The initial fight sequence in Japan was best continue shot I have ever seen in action movies. The Ending will bring out yours tears. One thing everyone should accept John Wick is a loving husband and is not dead yet.

anasshabra,"Just ... too much.

Not plausible at all; some places more like a video game with all the bodies dropping like flies, in some areas it in fact I would say it was stupid.

The special affects are amazing.

The different martial arts are impressive.

Loved the firearms handling.

All the different firearms were an amazing sight for me.

The scenes in Europe are beautiful.

As a technical movie it is great, however as reality it is horrible, even superheroes at not this ... ""invincible""

I wish they had toned it down few notches from borderline stupid to at least to plausible.

An entertaining movie that is all

ddunck,"There is a lying film, a very lying film, after 10 km, John Wick 4.

The only thing that saves the movie is the adrenaline that the movie causes. The rest is just a lie that if I were to describe everything here, it would take hours.

The action scenes are reminiscent of old Steven Seagal movies, the enemy who has the gun, instead of shooting from afar, prefers to arrive and aim closely, giving John Wick time to intercede with his arm and remove the gun, every fight has that . No one takes advantage of a moment when he's struggling to shoot him in the head from medium range. Like, overly lying.

The most lying part is that John Wick used a sniper-like weapon in the first film, and none of the super assassins used it against him. Knowing he was going to the final fight and all the way he was going to go. NOBODY used a sniper to shoot him, absurd. The only one who in theory thought a little about it, it wasn't even a sniper but a shotgun, he spared his life because John Wick had spared his dog.

I know that action movies have lies, lots of lies, that's what makes the movie cool. But everything has a limit, John Wick crosses the limit by 10 km.

Finally, no police intervene in Paris or anywhere else, despite a terrorist-level shooting or worse.",5
redonred,"This has to be just about the most brain dead, linear and un-thought provoking film I've ever seen.

A non-stop conveyor belt assault to the senses of dumb and almost motionless stooges are killed at a rapid fall rate, by a man who's almost 60 and looks like he can barely run or walk normally.

It trivialises death and fighting to such a degree that it all just becomes repititous, predictable and boring.

If it wasn't for the graphic and ceaseless violence you would think that you were watching a kids film due to its implausibility and ridiculousness.

How on earth did this take so much at the box office and what have we become as an audience that's prepared to pay for this nonsense?",1

If it was presented in a comedic way, it could be understood.

And what was Ian McShane doing there? - I have never seen such a bad acting, that is, there was none at all. It was much more pleasant to watch the match with Scott Adkins, it was fantastic and even humorous. Everything outside of the fights was better in content, including the legend of the movie's plot.

And the volume level of the movie is very high, even for me who likes loud, it was too loud. The administration of the cinema says that it was intended by the author of the film.",5
alwinsup,"Great, once again, join wick movie. Nice views, good vibe, new ideas and this time also better cast opponents. Espescially the French & Berlin actors. Yes.. sometimes the shooting scenes are a bit long and not all the acting is top of the line. But the movie has enough strong moments to counter these issues. A movie that all John Wick lovers would like to see! Hopefully they will continu these type of movie productions. Do get some snacks and drinks ready because it is a long sit. However the pace of the movie is good and will keep you entertainted all the way to the very end. See it in theater!",10
HOTSHOT100Real,"Just watched John Wick 4, OMG, the best action film of this year and by far has the be the best John Wick film in the series. The fight scenes were amazing, it was long but the film felt fast. This film is way better than John Wick 3 and big time better than John Wick 2.

Once again, good acting by Keanu Reeves as always he brings the character John Wick alive. It was good to see Hiroyuki Sanada in this film, I wished he had a bigger role but ill take his acting any-day. Donnie Yen was amazing in this film, I just wanted to see a big showdown one more time been his character Caine and John Wick but very good action from the both of them.

I love the new camera angle which you will see near the end of the film between the fight scenes.

We get more interactions between other characters and more people talking.

The Fight scenes just keep getting better and better. John Wick once again pushed to his limits and takes such much beating in this film. Please go and watch this film in the cinema for the story, action, jumper moments, the thrilling moments of the chase and mostly fight scenes.

The film ended in a very good way and personal, I think they should leave it with John Wick 4 only. How can you top this film. Dont push the series like fast has down. Go out with a bang. 10/10 & 5/5 rating for me.",10
GabrielSymes,"Probably the last JW film in this franchise. The first was daft action gore, and that set the scene for the following three outings. Except each new instalment came with a slightly more ridiculous story line. Number four does something remarkable. Yes, it is more ridiculous, there is more death and gore, and there is more action and impossible events. Fine, but why did they not bother with any sort of story? All you get, from start to finish, is more elaborate action scenes. And that is that. Once you become numb to the action gore, there is little else to hold your attention. There's even an absence of dialogue. Occasional cameos from well-known actors, awkward ""we were brothers"" moments, no light relief, and we have a fast-paced snooze-fest. A rewatch of JW#1 or even JW#2 would have been more enjoyable.",6
itsadityasharma,"An unbelievable action sequel, a masterpiece. From screenplay to actions, everything is just amazing and awesome. It's basically every thing in one movie. Even the shots of the movie were taken so beautifully. It has everything that you'll ever want in an action movie, probably more. Watched it twice both in IMAX theatres and I just can't bear the fact that I have witnesses a lot, really a lot of John Wick but will not be able to see it further.

Every character did a fantabulous job, and I also would like to appreciate the scale of the movie and the grandeur that it brings to the table with such amazing locations and shot really really well. You will not regret once you go into the theatres.

John Wick is my best action movies of all time and would like to quote: ""John Wick is a man of focus, commitment and sheer will.""",10
TheTexasChainstoreManager,"Unlike many other reviewers, i consider the John Wick story diminishing over time.

In the first movie, John Wick was Baba Yaga; the unkillable ghost that everybody had heard of and feared and there was an urgency to everything he did and had to do - from the first kill to the final boss. Every fight scene was meticulous and memorable and we got both high quality and enough quantity.

Over time, and especially in this final chapter of John Wick, almost everything of that is lost. Literally hundreds of assassins sacrifice themselves stupidly on John Wick like they've never heard of him and of course, they all get mowed down like cannon fodder. The fight scenes are no longer meticulous but rather average with repetitive moves, stuntmen waiting to get hit/killed, people entering timely in small groups like it's a video game with increasing difficulty. And to lower the urgency even more, bullets are no longer an issue since they all wear ""bulletproof suits"" that makes bullets bounce off like cotton balls, so now they can shoot A LOT more and it doesn't matter.

John Wick went from no nonsense to lots of nonsense and the director Chad Stahelski made one of the most common mistakes when it comes to movies like this; he sacrificed quality over quantity.",6

This movie is the most technically perfect and amazing ""action"" movie ever made. I haven't seen any IMAX film in years, but this is revolutionary. Glad I made the trip to the Chinese Theater.

Best film of the decade and truly magical in the most inconceivable way.

Of course NO SPOILERS. The less said, the better, but the ""required characters"" on IMDB review means repeating myself.

So, did I already say it's mind-blowing. The action choreography is ridiculously over the top. The sound is ear-splitting perfectionism.. some people might run out of the IMAX theater, their hair on fire.

Keanu Reeves's performance steps beyond understated, greatness, into acting immortality.",10
alisoozani,"How could you watch this movie and not laugh? If it was a comedy movie, I wouldn't have a problem with it. But as an action movie, it was really ridiculous.

In my opinion, if they want to make John Wick 5, he will have the power to fly, he can even shoot fire from his mouth or shoot lasers from his eyes.

Marvel can add the character of John Wick and become a member of the Avengers group, because he is stronger than all superheroes. Or if DC adds this character, I am sure it will be a serious threat to Superman.

With this type of movies, Hollywood is getting closer to Bollywood. I really hope John Wick 5 is not in the works, that's enough.",3
timeblank,"The movie is a stunning visual masterpiece with intense action scenes and memorable characters that leave a lasting impression. John Wick's final chapter showcases his anger and frustration as he seeks freedom through an old-fashioned duel. However, before he can even consider this, he must first overcome a seemingly insurmountable army of a thousand men.

John's incredible skills shine throughout the movie, while Donnie Yen, Tracker, and Marquis make excellent enemies, each driven by their own personal motivations. Despite the movie's lengthy runtime of 2 hours and 49 minutes, I found myself completely absorbed in every scene, losing track of time entirely.

Overall, the movie is a fantastic conclusion to the series, providing the perfect blend of action, intrigue, and suspense. It was an extremely enjoyable experience, and I thank the creators for bringing such a thrilling and engaging story to life.",10
hiraishinnojutsu,"Truly, the main selling point of this movie, that is the high octane action sequences, saves this movie from some, if not a lot, of its flaws. Just sit back and enjoy, rid yourself of the remaining little care you have for the world for the moment and witness what John must endure throughout the film that it would automatically drive you to think: ""How the hell is he still alive ?"". One thing that I found pretty funny about this movie is that it almost feels like a modern console action-adventure game, in which the story involves a side quest that John needs to complete to further the plot and get closer to its completion.

simianfriday,"I loved the first John Wick. It was a nice, simple, tight story with *great* action sequences that worked really well and revitalized a genre in a way we haven't really seen since Die Hard. The sequel was mostly more of the same but because they could smell the money making potential if they managed to turn this into a major franchise they started to layer on some more world-building details and lore. I didn't like it as much as the first movie but it was still good fun. The third movie is where this franchise started to lose me - sure, the action was still great for the most part, but the believability was starting to slip a little and all the lore they kept adding was beginning to feel more than a little absurd. Now, with this fourth movie... I'm really starting to think the writers just love the smell of their own farts. This franchise is so far up it's own... *ahem* posterior - that I don't think they can even see where they're going next. The action sequences are still very well choreographed and look great - but action sequences alone do not a movie make.

I would happily rewatch the first John Wick - it was and is a fantastic movie. I have no desire to ever rewatch any of the sequels and am probably done with this franchise at this point.",6

There' not much of a narrative going on, it it rounds the story off from the previous 3 well.

The fight scenes are just epic. You would think they would have run out of original ideas by now. But no - they still found new ways to off someone.

In fact the entire audience was well into the oo-ing and aah-ing. There were plenty of moments where you just laughed out load. Amazing how when done right it's strangely satisfying to watch someone else get violence done to them by the protagonist.

I'm usually the type to not finish a movie in one sitting. I easily get carried away or bored, but this masterpiece right here kept me entertained for three hours straight. I was laughing, I was scared, I was weeping, and I was serious. So many emotions for one great film. I rarely give 10 star reviews but this one deserves it most. You know it's a 10/10 if you're willing to watch it over and over and over again, and still love it every single time. Amazing film! Highly recommend watching! Great end to the series!

SeVarCas22,"The screenplay probably could be excellent and the film has one thing I've ever seen on others action films.

SCREENPLAY (Although, it is not bad, would be a good screeplay):

1.1. Bad Thing Of Film: It has bit hole on screenplay, due to John Wick immortality. John Wick alway got hurt and on this film it happens almost nothing to his body, it is something that doesn't happened on previous films because He always got hurt.

1.2. John's Japanese New Friend: On previous films doesn't explain who the f√ºck is Shimazu interpreted by Hiroyuki Zanada and/or how started frienship between John and Shimazu. Furthemore, how Caine and Shimazu have met.

FILM EDITING (Although, It is a bit good film editing, could be excellent):

1.1: John Wick Death: John got hurt, tells Winston he want to go home and ""his perspective"" to meet again with his wife on other world and periot doesn't happened anymore. Unless could be a death with dignity, what a mediocre death of John Wick.

1.2: A Great Film Editing Shot: I've almost got shocked while John tries arrives to Church, hold a big gun and camera moving on a senital shot from above all abandoned hotel while music immersing you on action scene. It is something new for me on Action Genre.",8

You have taken gun fighting and close combat action genre to another level!!",9
anchitbaishya2004,"The John Wick Franchise has changed and evolved throughout the years but the 4th installment in the series beats it's predecessors in literally every possible way. John Wick Chapter 4 combines all the components of its predecessors, but better. It delivers staggeringly choreographed action sequences, a mesmerizing climax with such visual and auditory style that it has set up new standards for action films moving forward. The characters were all pretty interesting and enjoyable with Keanu Reeves and Donnie Yen particularly killing it.

The story was mostly well written and pretty well thought out which at times feels like a video game quest. Though the film's nearly 3 hour runtime can drag a bit but it's easily excusable with so many other great stuff happening on screen.

The Cinematography was probably the highlight of the movie. This movie is filled with so many beautiful and vibrant shots along with such amazing set pieces which makes it even more engaging to watch. Absolute eye candy.

With this film, Chad Stahelski has proven to be one of the best action filmmakers of our time. Marvel better take notes.",9
chrisklugh,"Lets start with the good. The set design, lighting and some of these scenes are top notch. A mastery of light. Truly well done!

But Story is King and that's where I think they tried to hard and failed.

Chapter 1 was on point. It was accurate. The idea of Wick sent a shiver down my spine. Unfortunately the following Chapters tried to create that of feeling only found in movies with Kings, Dragons, and Wizards. Legend needs a History. In the first we assumed it, with our imaginations. But in the following, they tried to show it. And somehow that feeling did not translate well seeing it play out in the modern world. Our world just does not have that sort of feeling that we imagine from our past.

Some of the other short comings were blind impossible, like much of this movie. Tanking shots like it was a video game. Its sloppy compared to the accuracy of the first. Now if you look at it like that, some of these scenes are very well done. A testament to what a modern action movie can look like.

I want John Wick, from the first Chapter. Not the video game of its squeals. Somehow the last 3 movies made the first one even better. I don't have to imagine his Legendary Status, I know it, and now I know exactly why you don't steal his car and kill his dog!",6

Prob my only criticism is they had a couple of scenes where it was just so over the top the audience laughed as we were borught out of the reality of the movie.

I don't know if any movie will be able to top the dragon breath scene. Yeah, they sort of ripped it off a video game, but visually that was the most over the top yet believable action scenes I've seen in my life. Can't wait to be able to watch the movie again on Bluray and rewatch that scene a few times to really revel in the artistry and action.

I also plan to have a binge day to watch the 4 movies.",8
thoughton71,"Enjoyed this quite a bit. Superb cinematography, with especially fantastic colours, and generally great action scenes. There is one overhead camera scene which is absolutely brilliant. If I had to nitpick some of the fights went on for too long, and there is a 'falling down the stairs' bit which is slightly silly.

The only serious problem I had is the amount of punishment John Wick takes. The first couple of times he survives being hit by a car going at 50mph I can forgive. However he gets hit by at least 10 other cars throughout this movie and each time just gets up and walks away. He also falls out of several 3 or 4 storey buildings and merely shakes it off. A couple of them are simply ridiculous.

There is also quite a bit of what Jackie Chan calls ""wait in line fighting"", where the enemies patiently wait their turn to fight Wick one at a time.

And then there is Keanu's delivery of his lines. As one reviewer put it years ago, it's like watching your favourite nephew perform in a school play. You really want him to do well, but he's not quite up to the task.

It was great fun though. I'll probably watch it again next week. Keep an eye out for scene stealer Scott Adkins, in what I think is his best ever role.",8
saurabhtupe-68402,"Well i went in with a lot of expectations but came out quite disappointed.

I don't understand why so many people have given positive reviews.

The only part i liked in this movie were the last 15 minutes.

Every movie should have a balance of action & story but this one lags in the latter aspect. First 3 parts were quite good with enough time to develop the story as well.

There should have been more focus on who sits on the high table & what exactly is high table. There should have been more clarity on how much action they should have included.

You shouldn't ideally get bored of action but since it's too much you want the movie to get over asap.",6

fletcherw928,"John Wick is a funny franchise, and its origin is pretty funny too. People underestimated the first John Wick movie when it released in 2014. It just looked like another throwaway action movie with Keanu Reeves in it, but Keanu Reeves has an appeal all on his own. He has been criticized for his level of acting skill for as long he has been in the industry for since the late 80s, but he certainly isn't a terrible actor. Sure, his emotional range might not be the best of the best, but he still manages to give fine performances none the less. I thought he was pretty damn good in Speed as a passionate cop who just wanted to help people, and his anxiety outburst in The Matrix when he learns the truth was memorable as well. Anyway, people underestimated John Wick 1 and because of that, it seemed to exceed everyone's expectations as a well-directed action/revenge flick and also showcased a deeper side of Keanu's acting ability.

Anyway, after the success of the first film, it was obvious that a sequel would follow, and that's exactly what happened, and then a couple of years later there was a third one and suddenly it became a trilogy! The two following movies changed tone a little bit and became more avant-garde than the original, but these two movies improved on the action and took it to new levels.

Now that the fourth chapter is out, it once again brings the quality of action to new heights and now brings it closer to perfection than it ever has before. The action in this film is insanely well shot and directed and is extremely aesthetically pleasing and satisfying. The several action sequences are very lengthy too, with a couple going for over 10 minutes. The last time I saw an action sequence go for this long was in Mad Max: Fury Road almost 8 years ago, and it's pretty obvious that they took a lot of research from that film and how it was crafted. But here's a hot take, I think John Wick 4 is even better! Because unlike Fury Road, it has a story and characters that are on the same level as the action!

Every character in this movie is extremely rootable and has their own weaknesses and limitations, there is a blind character in this movie who is an extremely good fighter... but he's still blind and uses sound emitting sensors that he sticks to the walls, so he knows exactly where his enemies are in space, and I thought that was a very nice touch. John Wick himself is also very skilled at hand-to-hand fighting and shooting, but he also isn't a perfect fighting god and will be outsmarted sometimes. The Yakuza leader who ran the hotel in Osaka was great too, and his character was also built in the same way where he had his own strengths and weaknesses.

The characters are also very compelling and is clearly shown what each one is struggling with and also showing just how broken as a man Wick is at this point. A certain character changes sides but I won't spoil who. Also, the villain was also pretty good as well. He didn't really have that much of an understandable motivation; he was just ruthless and nasty and that's all he really needed to be. You don't need to explain an antagonist all the time, sometimes they can just be evil for the sake of being evil and that's fine and can also work as being entertaining. He was an intimidating presence, unlike Agent Smith in Matrix Resurrections which was a joke compared to Hugo Weaving.

Anyway, I was completely blown away by just how good the action was in this and just how long it went on for without becoming boring. It might just be one of my new all-time Action Favorites and highly recommend that you go see this on the big screen with the best sound. It really was a masterpiece of action with a great story to back it up!",10
michaeljameshill-98919,"There is a point in the movie that is filmed from above with John in the 3rd person, blasting enemies in a building with unlimited dragons breath shotgun shells like we are watching a photo-realistic version of Grand Theft Auto played by someone else. This is a pretty good metaphor for the movie itself. It is more video game than movie, with essentially no plot, detached from everything that made the first movie good. IMO it is just too ridiculous/over the top to draw the viewer into the experience. I'd add that there was essentially no acting in the movie to speak of and I'd be surprised if Keanu Reeves had more than a single page of dialogue in the entire film. It feels as if the writers took it as a personal challenge to make a movie with effectively no dialogue.

This movie is full of the improbable and nonsensical. For instance, one character uses a lever action rifle and six shooter. Another high level assassin is literally blind, but manages to take on multiple assailants at once with a sword and nail head shots with a pistol. In one scene high level assassins choose bows and arrows over firearms, etc., in another John is hook kicked in the head, falls 2 stories onto concrete, dusts himself off and is taking on multiple assailants seconds later.

Worst of all, the movie takes the fact that John was excommunicated (which they previously claimed couldn't be undone) and just says ""Oh yeah. That's not true, you just need to fight a certain character in a duel and win."". It would have been nice if they told him that in John Wick 3.

In my opinion this movie is the worst in the series, with John Wick 3 being close to it in terms of how bad it is. If you go into the movie knowing you are basically going to see a series of over-the-top action sequences without any real plot connecting them, and essentially no dialogue (other than grunts and muffled screams), then you'll probably enjoy this movie. Personally I could never get into it like I was able to watching John Wick 1 and 2.",5
trusso-36531,"The cinematography was some of the best I've seen in any movie holding up to films like blade runner and interstellar. The choreography is even better than the previous 3 films. The acting is even superb despite the other films lacking in that category, I was actually emotionally invested in this story more than I usually am during a movie and I walked away dumbfounded by it's surprising excellence. I would not have expected an action movie from a series known for being over the top and goofy to be such an incredibly well done movie, but it was. That being said, the film still manages to be quite funny and whimsical at times and is still over the top like John wick should be.",10
imdb-21226,"I don't get it. This movie (and the previous chapter) got such high ratings. The first two chapters had intrigue, action and a formidable foe. This one and the previous one have this strange tone with a type of fantasy 'bowing to the gods' type of thing. It is SOOOOO stupid. It's so cheap. I was shocked to see the same director made the first two chapters. The last two look like there had been huge efforts to make some over-the-top situations with the strangest of circumstances (neon lit glass rooms which is essentially a house of mirrors, a strange duel at 30 paces etc.) It's so transparent the efforts made to create outrageous situations. It's very cheap.

OMG has this franchise lost its way. There is absolutely no cache' like the first two chapters. I appreciate the homage to 'The Warriors' in Chapter 4.. but again.. its derivative. I am so disappointed.",4
jingbin-92646,"This is the best film I have ever seen. The sound effects and music are top-notch, the cinematography is excellent, and the fight scenes are intricately designed, blending multiple elements together seamlessly and leaving a satisfying feeling. I will visit the cinema again to watch this movie and recommend it to everyone.

Chinese martial arts, Japanese elements, and French art come together in this work, which not only showcases thrilling fight scenes but also features character dialogue that reflects diverse cultural backgrounds. It makes people ponder the driving force and logic behind revenge.",10
Kamil_An,"John Wick movies were always really great but this one moves past its limit. Nonstop action. You are in for a great surprise, and a treat, if you decide to give it a shot.

The best thing about the movie is probably the beginning as it is the key factor from which the whole purpose of the story unpacks. Moreover, a few scenes have some comedy in them, which definitely give the movie a positive edge, and make the movie stand out even more from its predecessors.

Other than that, great combat, great visuals, great narrative and most importantly, great plot!

Nothing other than a 10/10. Absolutely, utterly, bloody fantastic!",10
PaperCoffins,"Honestly , there's to much action , not enough sex on screen and Keanu is not a good actor . The set pieces of this movie was beautiful and again , the fights are well done but this movie just felt long and pointless . At times I seen about 4 people asleep in the theaters , then seen half of them pretty Much sleeping . One person puked from the constant action this movie kept throwing at your face . If you like pointless fights with a lot of violence , bad acting and terrible written characters , this movie fits right up your alley! Just bring a blanket , a pillow and get ready for the greatest action nap of your life .",3
garrys-core,"The CGI has some bad moments (randomly placed 2d arrow). The story doesn't make sense from where it left off... I was expecting a very angry John Wick aiming for his old friend, that isn't what happens.

John Wick was supposed to be the best of the best and has been fighting his competition mostly in 3, but now we get a bunch of assassins with close to equal skill like they've come out of a happy meal.

The background stories for the new main secondary character's skills don't matter and are lazily written (one guy is stupid good + blind and is close friend to another person who is a close friend who you don't care about), so much so they've just slammed a bunch of expensive actors in the roles to sort of let you know this person is a high class assassin.

This movie sort of reminds of an university level art class, were the students study and and mimick the original but don't quite get it. The art style is very similar, but its almost as if it gets confused about being a dark serious movie or a dark comic movie (it flips between the two too often).

I loved 1 - 3, but this is not what john wick should of been like in quality or story.

**edit** the thing felt so comicy bad, that the end reminds me of ghost rider the movie.",5
wjosephjorob,"The film is an action lover's dream. Filled with spectacular gun battles and chase scenes also the magnificent presence of Donnie Yen doing what he does best, overall continuation of the story from episode 3, this film is mostly one man's journey in getting revenge for disturbing his once peaceful existence, his previous life as Hitman or corporate assassin was only a memory until they killed the last living thing he cared about, the they as in his previous employer is now who he is on a mission to destroy completely, while the film is lacking in storytelling, it excels in giving the viewer a very colorful and highly stylized set pieces across several countries, which was quite impressive in my opinion, I also liked the kudo's to the film the Warriors for a particular reference to the DJ and the grandiose finale that had a taste of Sergio Leone spaghetti western sprinkled in for good measure, if there is any time to go back to the theater, well this is the movie to watch, if you are an action film lover, you will not be disappointed with this film.",8
Keemshave,"One of the best action movies ever made. They really leaned into what truly works in the John Wick franchise and went full-throttle on it. Non-stop action.

The best of the franchise by far. I wasn't a massive fan of the 3rd movie so for this one to rebound and really kickass is awesome to see.

I can think of multiple sequences in this that are easily some of the coolest scenes I've ever seen in a movie.

The story isn't perfect and there are a few bits and pieces that I didn't particularly love, but the overall epicness of the movie trumps any flaws it has. The runtime was a bit long but they make the absolute most out of that 2 hours and 40 minutes.

This is one of those movies where you are truly left wondering how they pulled off certain moments.

The ending was also good enough to bring it all home.

Favorite scenes: nunchuck fight, traffic fight, over-head shot of gun fight in house.",9
thesar-2,"If there's a 5, I'm certain it HAS to be a crossover with the Fast & Furious franchise. Yes, this is getting THAT live-action cartoonish.

I loved it, but there hasn't been a bad John Wick movie. In fact, after writing this review, I want to compile a best/most consistent Action franchises of all-time list. This series will HAVE to be at/near the top of the greats. Four movies in, four incredible feats.

Now, like I said above, this is getting pretty far-fetched. YES, John's survived countless ordeals, shots, hits and of course, heads-up battles with cars in the past 3 movies. Unfortunately, with this outing, they had me almost say, ""enough"" by the time the climax is over.

That all said, maybe I was too harsh with comparing this to the horribly over-the-top Fast & Furious films which are so fathomly unrealistic, I hated most of the movies in that series. I couldn't possibly even dislike any of the John Wicks. But...it is getting a little too hard to suspend disbelief.

So, John's in a pickle. When has he not been since his dog and car were taken from him in 2014? John must face many bosses before the climax and you can bet he'll be battling much of the almost-three-hour runtime.

The more I think about this, the more I like it. It is NOT perfect, and I would certainly rank 1 and 3 higher. Still, you need to see this if you're a fan.

As mentioned, this is nearly three hours. Mercifully, it does NOT feel that way. Well, for the most part. I examined a few scenes that dragged out longer than they should have and they were some of the non-action scenes, of course. Everything else: you're just along for the glorious ride of watching John Wick fight countless henchmen to reach his goal.

While it doesn't have the depth of 1 or the Halle Berry of 3, it's a worthy chapter in an otherwise fantastic franchise. It's also pretty good looking and has some incredible side characters with complex motives that I absolutely LOVED. In fact, the more the movie went along, the more I loved how they kept the two main side characters fresh for the three acts.

I do hope there's a John Wick: Chapter 5, but if it ends here, I'm totally fine. I mean, they kept trying to reboot TV's 24 after it's exciting and conclusive 8 initial seasons and that was a huge mistake.

John Wick's rep established in the first one holds up here. SEE THIS!!

Final Thoughts: Here's my ranking:

1. John Wick (2014) ~ EASY #1

2. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum

3. John Wick: Chapter 4 ~ barely beating out the 4th spot

4. John Wick: Chapter 2.",8
Ameliex,"I saw this in the theaters yesterday and WOW Keanu Reeves kills it!

I'm reading the reviews here and 99% of everyone seems to have given this movie a 9 or 10.

The reason I didn't give this movie a 10, is due to a bit of too much action. Just a little bit.

But what a thrilling action movie. And damn Keanu Reeves is hottttt in this movie, God damn!

To get the whole experience, you have to watch this in the theatres though!

I was thinking 1 hour and 49min would be too long, but where the hell did the time go? I don't know. Time flew by as if this movie was only one hour long.

In every scene, something happens and it will leave you on edge every second. Something happens every second in this movie.

I know Keanu Reeves is loved around the world, and this movie just cemented his ''goat'' status!

If you are an action junkie, obsessed with action movies, and LOVE Keanu Reeves then this movie is for you.

Don't forget to have snacks and drinks close by, because you need something to snack on or drink to calm your nerves seeing this.",9
raven-11881,"Saw it yesterday at the cinema. Well, I can't quite agree with the praise.

The film is clearly too long, the action scenes all get out of hand and you only see more of the same killing scenes, which are boring and tough in the long run. Less would have been more here.

Attention, there are a few spoilers to a few fight scenes.

Chapter 4 takes the ""nonsense"" to the extreme again. I'm a fan of well choreographed fights, but not when it's just overplayed to the max. John Wick once again fights HORDES of assassins and walking fortresses, but they are all too stupid to hit John and always miss. It's also interesting that John Wick must think he's Neo, since he's constantly ""dodging"" bullets by ducking and taking slight sideways steps. By John being invincible, it's just not fun to watch him kill, because it's unsatisfying victory, kind of like a cheat in a game or some kind of god mode. It would have been much more intense and emotional for me as a viewer if John was significantly more vulnerable and if there had been more noticeable character development and motivation. It would have been enough to reduce the kill count from over 200 to under 20, but to stage the individual fights more brutally, more intensively and, above all, more realistically and credibly (e.g. As in Atomic Blonde or Mission: Impossible).

I also find these ""armored"" suit guys stupid. John often shoots whole magazines at these guys, and the bullets bounce off the suit as if the outer fabric was already made of 1 cm steel. But the fact that the suit guys are still very agile is even more laughable. And the suits are still as clean and intact as if they had just been bought and ironed. These suit guys don't have head protection, though, which is why I find it ridiculous that John imemr shoots at their bodies and not directly at their heads. He seems to be shortsighted, because he only ever shoots at the head when he's extremely close to the enemy. However, when enemies wear complete body armor including ballistic helmets, John strangely always shoots at their heads even from a distance, until after ten or fifteen shots he finally shoots into the helmet/head from below. If you multiply these kind of kills by 100, you have an idea of how often John kills hundreds of killers in the same way.

Furthermore, I find it very nonsensical that there are no police in the world who intervene at times.

The scene in Paris at this big traffic circle with several lanes is also totally crazy. John and the killers shoot at each other on the traffic circle for over ten minutes, and the ""civilians"" just drive on like robots at 50 km/h and just keep running over some killers and John, though John never takes any damage from it. But no one stops, gets out and runs away in fear. The traffic keeps flowing, despite wild killing by shooting and wild running over.

As for the staging of the action scenes: For every well-staged action scene, there are unfortunately three mediocre and boring action scenes that always follow the same pattern, see my comments above. And even the best action scenes are not necessarily as ""groundbreaking"" or ""novel"" and ""groundbreaking"" as some critics claim. I found a whole two action scenes very successful, once the much too short! (where all the others are way too long) chase scene in the Mustang and once the top-down fight scene. The highly praised staircase fight scene I found again much too long and also very 08/15, because John again makes his always same kills, while all the others always hit only the staircase railings or lanterns, but not John.

The story isn't worth mentioning and doesn't make much sense in terms of content. Interestingly enough, the nice dialogues and dialogue scenes are still one of the best things about the movie.

The sound is well mixed though, the camerawork is well done and the visuals are very aesthetically pleasing and there are a few nice references to Matrix (rain fight scene and the train station).

Now all of this sounds rather like a poor or mediocre rating, but that wouldn't do the film justice. It offers good entertainment on a technical level above mediocrity and Keanu Reeves is always fun to watch. Therefore I still give it a solid rating, despite all my reservations.

Rating: 7/10 points

Rewatch Value: Low

Emotional depth: Low

Lasting impression: None.",7
iozappa,"When people give an Indian movie nine and ten stars I know in advance there is local patriotism involved. When Western spectators give John Wick: Chapter 4 nine and ten stars I assume they're teenagers enjoying protracted action scenes. Not my cup of tea. The ten-minute (or more) long fights are extremely boring and ridiculous (John Wick falling on the stairs several times or the knife and gun, mano a mano Paris square fights are particularly bad), even when applying a high dose of suspension of disbelief. If the Hollywood directors want some inspiration (which they're in dire need of) they could take a look at the fight scenes in Carter, a Korean movie. The high-speed chase with the bad guys attacking from cars and motorcycles through the missing doors of a van is one of the best I've seen in decades.

Keanu Reeves is sporting some oily hair, has bad diction and his contribution, according to the poor script, is limited to several ""yeahs"".

The Swedish impersonator of the Marquis is far from being a worthy villain.

Is there anything good I can say about this movie? Visually it is sometimes excellent (Japanese screens, palace interiors) and from an acting point of view the dog had the best scene when peeing on a dead bad guy!

Let John Wick rest in peace and never be resurrected!",3
Entertainmentsparadise,"The fourth installment of John Wick defies logic. While history shows franchises' movie quality fades by the 3 or 4 fourth installment, John Wick proves to be an outlier as it provides the action-packed teeth-clinching scenes that make it such a spectacle and then some.

There's only John Wick, the killer, And he's going to kill you John Wick included some gnarly action scenes ( go figure) with me at the edge of my seat exclaiming: ""Oooh, that's tight"" or ""oooh, that hurt,"" as many of the sequences reminded me of arcade-style games like Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, and Tekken. The attention to detail with vibrant colors throughout the environment and the extras served as the 'nonplayable characters' as the camera shifted the primary focus- the main characters ( such as John Wick) fighting while utilizing their surroundings to their benefit. The variation in fighting styles, such as hand-to-hand combat, wrestling, ground, and pound, a final standoff battle, and melee attacks with swords and nunchucks, provides just enough to make this film stand out.

Are you ready, John? Yea John wick also defies logic by being impervious to fall damage because how does he survive two significant falls and gets up like nothing ever happened? Some dull moments are expected from a 3-hour movie, and surprisingly some unexpected comical relief.

Fools talk, Cowards are silent, Wise men listen.

Ultimately John Wick 4 is an excellent send-off for a successful Franchise. I just found out that there might be a fifth. If you like action, all smoke, not much talking, and are a John Wick fan, then definitely watch this!

I rate John Wick an 8/10.",8
JasonR8844,"Honestly have to wonder when reading some reviews here if they were watching the same film as me.

Without any doubt the best of all John Wick. A masterpiece of entertainment. Cinematography from Dan Laustsen is just incredible. This with some great Directing from Chad Stahelski and well paced and considered dialog. Some great lines delivered well from a great cast. This has to be one film to see more than once, just to take a second look at the brilliant fight scenes. Incredible work by so many on this film.

You get what you expect from John Wick and then some in spades. This for me, the most fun watching one of the best action films made to date. Don't miss it. Brilliant from beginning to end.",10
CineFreakk,"Pros: Some imaginative camera work, overall great cinematography and impressive sets.

Cons: Endless, repetitive fights where a million bullets from supposedly trained killers bounce off Wick's kevlar suit but somehow never manage to hit his head, poor acting and a plot as thin as a Keanu's beard.

Even though John Wick movies never pretended to be anything but mindless violence, they used to be entertaining to watch but if this is to be the final act in the series, it is a very sad way to go.

The fighting scenes were so long and repetitive that I had to fast forward through a lot of them.

Stay clear unless you really have nothing else to do for the next 3 hours!",3
ops-52535,"Miss the sound of a police sirene in the background, when sinking deeper and deeper into the gloomy afterlife of an overkill session. John wick is the phantom of the modern day, not the bengaly one living in the caves of skulls, cause he will survive and will endure an eternal life, therefore be ready for number 5.

It seems to me that theyve learned some fighting coregraphics from the south korean action film making, well set and done, but its made and filmed in an awful kind of darkness, thats hiding more than revealing the consequence of life and death and the quality of the acts.

So until theyve taught mr wick to walk, as for now it seems like hes got a candle light up his spina iliaca caudata, he will always appear like phil lynott's ''im a just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail''. And when that day comes i might consider. Keanu reeves an actor for the real hall of fame. I liked the action, but the script is dry as the horn of africa. Wonder how the playbook looks like. Anyway a recommend from the grumpy old man.",8
seige-hound,"If I were rating this film soley on the fight choreography and cinematography, I would give it an 11/10. Not only is this one of the best looking action films I've ever seen, it also, for the most part, contains the best action setpieces. Watching this film reminded me most of playing a video game. I'm currently playing the Resident Evil 4 remake, and even though John Wick isn't a horror movie, the action was most reminiscient of a survival horror experience, with Wick constantly scavenging weapons and ammo from fallen enemies. There's no infinite ammo hacks in the Wick series, and that continues.

The bigger issue is plot armour, which Wick has in droves. His suit is explained to be made of Kevlar, but no amount of Kevlar justifies the amount of punishment he survives. Also the choreography of one of the minor characters, named Akira, was slightly lacking. She used a bow and arrow and Judo throws, but the enemies she fought were on easy mode compared to Wick's. Don't blame the actress necessarily, she probably just needed a little more practice. Fortunately she was only in one fight scene, and the rest of the action was very fun to watch.

My other gripe is the story. Every subsequent Wick film escalates both the action, and the plot contrivances to justify the action. The world of John Wick is one where half the population are assassins, and there are no cops. Seriously, the climax of the film is set in Paris, and there are NO COPS ANYWHERE, while Wick is killing droves of people across four different popular landmarks in peak traffic conditions. There's also an office for the Table (or whatever the assassin org is called) in the Eiffel Tower, where a DJ uses barely coded language to tell all the assassins where Wick is going. It's peak silliness.

I'm not gonna dock too many points for this, but I think it is possible to make a movie that has both top tier action and a comprehensible plot with good worldbuilding. Wick has the former and not the latter. We know that there are good action movies with great resonant plots out there. Stuff like Everything Everywhere shows that it is possible. The Matrix still holds up in this regard too (though the action has aged a little) and maybe the future of this franchise will offer better stories as well.

In any case, if you want 2 1/2 hours of fantastic action, John Wick 4 continues to deliver.",8
terrencegreen-46791,I'm struggling to see where all these high ratings are coming from! Poorly written script lacking continuity of the previous Wicks. This movie feels like the story is being made up as they move along under 3 hours of fighting. At two hours I was ready for this to end! Many of the fight scenes felt like previous scenes we've seen before that makes this movie extremely redundant and predictable. Maybe people don't want to see dialogue anymore. Instead a studio can give you hours of useless fight scenes over and over again! This one truly misses the mark. This wick on this candle is finished!!!!!,3
ACollegeStudent,"Rating: 7.2

The best of John Wick. We get closure to the high table debacle and unexpectedly John Wick pays the price for all his mistakes and actually dies here after achieving true freedom. The side characters that helped John along the way were the most interesting out of the previous wicks as they felt like real people with nuance even though they themselves didn't have many layers. We had the typical wick plot armor here of him: getting hit by cars, falling off buildings, etc, and somehow surviving, and I didn't like how Wick let himself die after achieving his freedom and the loophole of Wick not firing his pistol in the duel and the marquis conveniently giving Donnie Yen his freedom even though Wick isn't dead yet, then Wick blasting the marquis. There's no way they planned to do that otherwise Yen wouldn't have shot Wick in a vital area or he would've just done this on his first shot. Mostly satisfying conclusion to John Wick.",7
jviaes,"This was definitely a wild ride. Saw a review saying John Wick getting shot at so much without getting shot was unrealistic. I mean the whole concept is unrealistic which is why he is the Baba Yaga. Also the bulletproof lining in the suits help.

What was unrealistic was the fat guy being able to land a few kicks on John Wick. Now if he was more of a traditional boxer than a kicker, than would make more sense.

Donnie Yen really ruled in this. My favorite thing he did in the film was (being blind) he use a barrel of the gun find a man's face so he could hit him. It was pretty sweet what they did with his character.

I wish the daughter at the beginning had more of a presence, but in terms of female fighters, preferred her MUCH better than Halle Berry's character in chapter 3.

Best part for my enjoyment was the fight in the old building. They did a single shot that panned out and gave a bird's eye view of the fight scene and it was awesome.

Sadly, it looks like they may have actually buried John Wick in this one. However, I suspect Baba Yaga is not actually gone. When they were at his grave, John's dog turned and looked off in the distance so I'm wondering if he saw John.

One sad part was the concierge being killed given the real life actor had passed away in real life.

So not a 10/10 because of the fat guy being able to land size-able kicks, but all in all EPIC.",9
southdavid,"I'll have to admit that, having been a fan of the first two, I was a little disappointed with ""Parabellum"". I felt after a stellar start, it was a bit too long and some of the repetition in the fights was a bit wearing. It's interesting about the way movies work, that I too felt this was overlong, and repetitive, but it ends (rather than starts) with such a phenomenal series of action moments that I feel much better about it than I did the last one.

With John Wick (Keanu Reeves) touring the world damaging the reputation of ""The Table"", they task The Marquis Vincent De Gramont (Bill Skarsgard) with finally bringing him to heel. Having extracted a terrible revenge on The New York Continental, Gramont blackmails blind assassin, and former friend of Wick, Caine (Donnie Yen) to hunt him down. Now a serious liability to his friends, Winston (Ian McShane) comes forward with a plan to free Wick from his debts once and for all.

I think I'd actually go as far as to describe the first two thirds of the movie as being lacklustre. It's only really Donnie Yen's reluctant killer that offers anything that we haven't seen before. Much of those earlier scenes seen Wick killing hordes of heavily shielded enemies, so again, as with the third one, the bullets are more to stun people rather than kill them outright. The Marquis sees Skarsgard, play aristocratic villain, which again the series has done before, though not perhaps with someone struggling as much with the accent as he is.

There are some raw moments with Lance Reddick in these early scenes too, who, as ever, was great.

The last third though, from the moment he steps out of the subway into Paris and battles across the city is phenomenal. It's a breathless action scene that lasts around 45 minutes, barely pausing for a moments respite. It seems him use cars, motorbikes, and all sorts of the weaponry to fend off assassins sent to stop him reaching a certain destination and it really makes great use of Paris as a character in the action. I must say, the scenes when he uses ""Dragons Fire"" bullets is perhaps the most video game thing I've seen a movie do. All the earlier inertia is blown away by perhaps the best sequence the series has ever done, and I do think that I probably feel warmer about the film because it ends with it's best sequence, whereas Parabellum opened with it.

I think I'm happy for the story of John himself to end here. We've got a couple of spin offs that are in development that can keep the world going, but I'd really struggle to think what more they could do.",8
ColinTheGorilla,"This is one of the best action movies I've ever watched and it's truly magnificent to watch. I can't believe this movie was that good and I'm so happy it was so good. I love all the new characters introduced like Caine, Mr Nobody and a lot more other characters which were super enjoyable to watch and I began to like these characters quite a ton. I feel like some people won't like the ending of this movie but I think it was super well written and a great way to the end the movie. Keanu Reeves was such a badass as John Wick yet again as he was so damn cool and great to watch in this movie. Overall this movie is quite phenomenal.",10
burntoutboy,"In terms of action movies, this is up there with one of the best. In terms of shooting action movies, this is the best. Nothing comes close.

It's nice to watch an action movie where you can see every gunshot and the consequence of them. No shakiness with the camera, you see everything from all different kind of angles. Also shows you don't need big explosions or massive set pieces to really have a great action movie.

John wick chapter 4 does have big set pieces but the action involved is so close range it doesn't feel like they are big set pieces. I especially feel the cinematography really compliments this and is key to making the action top notch.

My only concern was with the massive run time of almost 3 hours but it definitely didn't feel like it. It didn't drag like other long films over the past year (wakanda forever and the batman as examples)

I also watched this in Imax and I'm so glad I did. It was definitely made for an Imax screen.

You need to go watch it in the cinema, I can't recommend it enough!",10
kamazafacka,"John Wick 4 is a very good movie.

There are a lot of action scenes in the film (Fights, shootouts) the film is shot very beautifully. The best part is John Wick.

An interesting plot.

A spectacular action movie.

One of the best films of 2023.

John Wick is a great franchise.

I advise you to watch this movie. I really liked this movie.

Good directorial work by Chad Stahelski.

A good script by Shay Hutten.

Bill Skarsgard plays well.

Keanu Reeves plays very well. Keanu Reeves is a very good actor. Keanu Reeves is one of the superfluous Hollywood actors. Watching everything with Keanu Reeves.",10
damianphelps,"I'll start with the bad bits as the good bits speak for themselves.

At part four I would like and expect some more character development. A deeping of the universe and expansion of the mythology. Wick Four really offers none of that. It has the Marquis, but who is he, how was he chosen, what's his background, give me something.

3 was good but repetative. The fights simply going on too long. I think if most people were honest when they looked at the running time of part 4 they would have been worried about this repeating. Thankfully the fights are long but they are kept interesting and different especially towards the closing of the story.

The style of the film is great, looks amazing and is super entertaining :) I would love to see a 5 if the can dive a little deeper.",7
William_Pahllace,"Just watched John Wick 4 and jesus, I DID NOT like this movie. It was nearly three hours long but it barely justifies two. The action and stunts are very good but when it's non stop for hours on end, my eyes just glaze over. The story is nonsensical and infuriatingly overly complex. Every single place in these movies is an elaborate hideout with neon lights and candles and racks of shiny guns. Everything is so polished and there are hundreds of henchmen in $1000 suits. You never feel like you're in a real place. A real bar, a real hotel, a real train station. When EVERYTHING is special, NOTHING is.

Apparently every single person in the world is an assassin... there are no normal people in this world. No veterinarians, no grocery store baggers, no police, no teachers. Everyone is a goshdang assassin. That's not interesting!!

Oh there's a special currency these assassins use in this world? When everyone has a gold coin, that's just called currency. Oh there's a special hotel just for assassins? Oh wait, there's one in every country and there's hundreds of people in every lobby. That's just called a hotel.

These movies make the most incredible, jaw dropping, fascinating things mundane.

If everything is special then nothing is.",4
jonny_,"In terms of modern action movies it's one of the better ones. The story is somewhat secondary to the action which is absolutely fine. The cinematography is very clean, the characters are interesting and the locations look great.

My main hang-up with the John Wick movies and more modern action is ironically the fight scenes. Since there are so many, it all ends up following the same patterns. 50 guys will show up, he'll shoot two or three at a time, there will randomly be a big gap when he can run out of ammo or drop his weapon to do a mini fight and MMA takedown pick up another conveniently placed gun and headshot them. Then instantly some more guys turn up only when he's ready but he'll also miss the miniboss henchmen despite hitting everything else with headshots, rinse and repeat. It is too choreographed, even when they try to make it look like he could possibly lose.

I'm fine with suspending some disbelief when it comes to these things because it is fantastical, but the issue is that it's a little repepetive and there are next to no stakes the more it happens especially since he wears literal plot armour. Plus if you look at any background henchman during these things there are weird time fills. There's literally a part in this when he's fighting one guy and someone in the background stands up and hugs a drum and falls back down because they're clearly having to wait and it's just out of place. Especially when you have Donnie Yen in your movie who famously does fight scenes with multiple people all at once.

I do like that they change it up a bit with the car scene and the gunfight shot from overhead, the real shining moments of this movie are they go through with everyone essentially ""winning"" but still had the courage to end the movie the way they did because they could easily have chickened out. Plus of course big points for the whole dog part, it had the best story, best action and best humour and arguably the best ending.",7
Goldrobinzon,"The previous chapters were entertaining because they walked a thin line between what is possible and ridiculous, but still remained kind of believable. The last chapter didn't just cross the line, it's light years past it. It's like watching Captain America and Chirrut √émwe navigate an utopia where assassins comprise half of the world's population and kill each other in broad daylight. All the while, regular civilians are so used to it that they just keep dancing right alongside all the bloodshed, or simply drive over the dead bodies. After all, Arc de Triomphe or disco lights in falling water look just so damn good to bother about, I don't know... your life? Aside from that, almost every scene suffers from the realism being sacrificed for aestheticism of the shot or nods to either past chapters or just completely unrelated films, such as Marvel, Star Wars, etc. Add the zero sense in the Swiss cheese of a plot, and even Keanu's very well executed stunts cannot save the movie. Huge disappointment. P. S. They shouldn't have agreed to Donnie Yen's demands to change his character in an attempt to break Asian stereotypes, while the rest of script and half of the characters remained Asian, and quite traditionally lacked any kind of dimension. That just made an already broken movie look so much more laughable.",3
aadarshstha-92565,"This is one of the best action franchise (if not the best) of the recent years. I remember watching Chapter 2 and 3 in the theatres, I was at awe looking at the action sequences and also the visuals. This franchise had, hands down the best action choreography in Hollywood history. It's brutal, gory, thrilling and exciting.

And today watching Chapter 4 was no ordinary, this one had one of the best action sequences as expected but also the cinematography and soundtracks were top-notch. I loved every bit of it. Scott Adkins as 'Killa' reminded me of 'The Penguin' (Colin Farrell) in The Batman (2022), which was another brilliant cinematic experience I had last year. But this film, I was totally blown all the characters and the character study was top-notch.

I still think Chapter 2 is the best film in the franchise, but this film is definitely top-tier. Bill Skarsg√•rd was good but Donnie Yen stole the show. Keanu Reeves is freaking awesome and this is by far his best performance yet. The action is crisp, well directed and is beautifully choreographed. And there is one scene which is so well shot and that is the highlight of the film for me and has a great impact on the film.

However, on the minus side, it drags a bit in the middle but it's just a minor subject. Can be ignored. Nevertheless, I was consistently entertained for the nearly three straight hours.",9
harry_tk_yung,"This movie has been characterized by critics as ""worth two years' wait"" (delay in release date). That is obviously in the context of Wick's fans, who know what to expect. A simple illustration. In one scene, one character has his hand nailed to a table by a sharp knife that goes right through the plump flesh joining the thumb and the index finger. Asked to choose between pulling the knife away and pulling the hand away, he chooses the hand! That is, without moving the knife, he drags his hand away clear of the blade. John Wick stuff. Just hope it is your cup of tea.

This movie is an action symphony of three movements. Plot is almost non-existent, a plus. The movie is all about killing John Wick (Keanu Reeves), or killing ""the idea"" of John Wick, if you want a little philosophical spicing. Along the way, Wick entertains an assortment of opponents, all deadly, needless to say. The opponents however do not necessarily target only John. They fight each other, or at least each other's goons, as they all want the prize, Wick, for themselves.

The omnipotent ""Table"", now headed by the vain French Marquis (Bill Skarsgard), is gung-ho on taking Wick out. Marquis recruits an old friend of Wick, a blind assassin called Caine (Donny Yan), making him now a frenemy of John. A bounty hunter with ""an emotion support dog"" (or is he emotionally supporting the dog? I'm confused), offers his service to the Marquis for 35 million dollars, later raised to 40. When this Tracker (no other name) yells ""nuts"", you know where the dog goes straight for, in the anatomy of a target victim.

The scene of the first movement is a plush hotel in Osaka, where old friend (apparently Wick has many) Shimazu (the inimitable Hiroyuki Sanada from ""Twilight Samurai""), with is badass daughter Arika (Rina Sawayama), harbours Wick. All hell break loose when the Table's goons descend en mass. Apologies for repeating what is said about a John Wick movie: if you are toying with the idea of doing a body count, forget it, or seek help from an AI. It also pitches frenemies Wick and Caine against each other, with both coming out unscathed. Other combatants show up too, including Tracker and dog. This entire lengthy movement is a joy to watch from beginning to end, shot brilliantly with abundant varieties in camera angle, colour scheme, light-and-shade, movements choreographed and solid, and of course the iconic gun-fu melee style to which Wick movies can rightfully claim patent. Great, matching funky music too.

The middle movement starts in to Russian where Wick, seeking help from a kingpin that he does not know has died, is now at the daughter Katie's mercy. The set piece is at the lair of massive Killa (Scott Adkins), the man who killed Katie's father. It's difficult to surpass the first movement, but the second one holds its own, with axes as the main theme. Caine and Tracker, needless to say, wouldn't miss the party. Towards the end of the endless struggle, Killa, in frustration, flashing his teeth that reminds you of Jaws in the James Bond movie, yells at Wick ""Why don't you just die!"" The victory regains Wick's place in the Russia brotherhood, with a family crest that puts him into a position to be able to challenge the Marquis to a single, one-on-one combat.

The final movement is set in the City of Light, but ironically reaches its climax when light yields to the rising sun. I wouldn't disclose the exciting journey through a night in Paris that Wick goes through to make it to the combat venue just before sunrise, to be allowed to take part in the duel. I have already said too much and wouldn't dream of spoiling your enjoyment of this superb finale of the nearly three-hour movie. Just absolutely top-notch, a worthy conclusion of this fourth John Wick movie.

On the cast, in addition of those already mentioned, there are Ian McShane as Winston, sort of advisor to Wick, and Laurence Fishburne as Bowery King who to Wick is as ""Q"" is to Bond. Must be mentioned however is Yan, who is close to being a co-lead here. In addition to being assigned what he does best, he also gets a couple of profound philosophical lines such as ""The dead are gone. Only the living matters"" or ""see you in the next life, brother"". Caine and Wick reflect off each other, and hence bot shine brightly.",N/A
qzbc-08585,"A movie should tell a story, right? Perhaps take a person away for roughly two hours on a trip?

Rough edit: let's cut to the chase

This movie is mindless unrealistic violence from start to finish. A little goes a long way, yet this was a long way (long film) which offered little.

Know the difference between a movie and a film? Someone once said a film is European and has dialogue and a movie is the same film remade by Hollywood with action sequences, gunfire and explosions.

Now I don't mind Hollywood - you get what you pay for right? And sometimes Hollywood is just what the doctor ordered!

But this film treats the view as stupid.

What I liked about the first John Wick films is he gets physically hurt (the rest of us would have been in an ICU hospital ward or dead), even if only a little.

But John Wick 4 - is he Captain America? Does he have Wolverine's healing powers?

At 2:49 minutes L O N G, I found myself skipping forward in 10sec blips just to end this mindless, brain numbing spectacle.

A wise man once said ""Stupid is as stupid does."" If you succumb to watching this film after my review here, the quote above may be speaking about you.",1
triplex23,"If you love a non stop violent action movie with perfectly choreographed fight scenes then this is the movie for you. If you like a crazy story, which is emotional and pulls you in, then this is the movie for you.

If this is the end for John Wick then it was a fitting way to go out. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.

Sometimes a movie with non stop action will get old and boring very quick, but the constant scene changing keeps it fresh. I love that Wick takes no prisoners, everyone dies.

I just hope there will be a chapter 5, these movies are some of the best action going around.",10
masonfisk,"Keanu Reeves comes back for the final chapter in his franchise (don't worry there's a Ana De Armas & Continental spinoffs in the works) currently in theaters. Reeves has reached the end of his journey where he has to regain his claim to a seat at the table (by reinstating his gangster status w/his own clan) so he can get his past deeds wiped by the head of the organization, played by It's Bill Skarsgard, a French Marquis who has Clancy Brown be his mouthpiece while Reeves' advocate, Ian McShane, just wants his hotel (destroyed by the Marquis in the film's opening gambit) reopened. Reeves now has to globetrot around the world to reach France where a final duel (w/pistols) will take place but not before a legion of assassins, led by a blind Donnie Yen & a dog owning Shamier Anderson, get to him first. Clocking in at a punishing 3 hours (yes I did nod off for a bit) for no apparent reason but to flex ideas the writers/directors came up w/in preproduction, the film sometimes is exhaustive fun but other times just exhausting w/filmic tips of the hat to everything from Lawrence of Arabia to Walter Hill's The Warriors trying to get some clout to a franchise which frankly doesn't need it. Luckily Reeves barely has any dialogue & moves from set piece to set piece like a speared shark w/his only goal is to make it through the next fight alive. Also starring the late, great Lance Reddick as McShane's right hand man at the hotel, Hiroyuki Sanada as the owner of the Japanese Continental, Laurence Fishburne returning as Reeves' street level compatriot, poor Scott Adkins in a silly fat suit & singer Rina Sawayama as Sanada's daughter who wields a mean bow & arrow.",7

Jeremy_Urquhart,"You know you're in good hands when a film begins with Laurence Fishburne being used to explicitly shout out Lawrence of Arabia (I see what you did there, movie).

John Wick: Chapter 4 is more John Wick. It is likely exactly what you're expecting it to be, but if you're like me and you had high hopes for this fourth installment, you're likely to be pleased by what the film delivers, even if it doesn't entirely blow expectations away. The title character is once again put up against plenty of people who want him dead. The story is designed in a way to get him to travel to various locales, all of which are well-utilized in the action scenes. And when it comes time for those action scenes themselves, they're largely spectacular.

Things manage to escalate even more from the gleefully over-the-top Chapter 3, but I will say, the opening half-hour to 45 minutes of this proves to be surprisingly restrained. The momentum never slows down too much, but to some extent, it takes its time to get all the pieces in place. After that's done, things don't let up much at all, and I was glad to see the non-stop energy and fighting of the third film's opening act replicated here, except this time it plays out during the final act, and in a new location.

There were other key details I really liked. One action scene is shot in a way that looks like a live-action version of Hotline Miami, and the results are pretty great. There's also some really good music used throughout, including Justice's Genesis (not the only on-the-nose music choice, given they're a French House duo and the scene it plays during takes place in Paris, but it fits the heightened style of the movie).

You do feel the length at some points, and I don't think it's the best-paced recent blockbuster with a three-ish hour-long runtime. Still, it delivers stylish action, a high-stakes, kind of goofy, but engaging and simple story, and Keanu Reeves and a talented supporting cast all doing their thing. The creativity and stuntwork found in the action sequences are great, and it all adds up to what might be the best entry in the whole series (beating out Chapter 3 by a hair for me).",8
martin-653,"I had high expectations for the film, but already after 30 mins, it sure let me down a lot.

The action is well zum zum, sure it's a lot of it, but many times you just see it like this: One of the bad guys throws a punch, it is such a slow punch i probably could taken a bath room break while he try to hit John, and still be back before the next one. You also see them punch into nothing, for just to wait ¬Ω a sec til John can react, the action is not fluid most of the times, really a big let down :(

And then what the heck is up with those Jackets, bullet proof and what not, come one really? This is the lazy mans ""mechanic"", cant figure out a way to get all those bullets flying other wise, else every one would have been dead within 20 mins of the movie, so give every man a Superman ""cape"" and be bullet proof pff...

Then its where John shoots them in the face 20 times, and they do not die, because they have a mask on lmao, but then shortly after you see John picking up a nunchaku, and they then cover their faces to not get hit, again WTF, they can take 20 hits close up into the face from a gun, but they are afraid of a bit of wood?

Yeah this movie is sure a big let down compared to the other ones, sorta happy there wont be a new one, should had stopped at nr. 2 or 3 :(",5

Even my wife, who usually watches Lifetime movies and hasn't seen John Wick 1-3, enjoyed it and now wants to see the first three films. Great cast too! Not as much humor as the first three classic films but the pace and story made an almost three hour movie go quickly. We will definitely watch part four several times.

There are three or four moments of action sequences that are just incredible. I found myself smiling to what I was witnessing.

The movie was also extremely well shot, I can also remember a couple of camera views that were just perfect.

Osaka and Paris were also very well chosen places to film, it gives an extra humph of culture to the movie.

jk_99,"I hope Hollywood gets the message that we are very bored of the same old tired tropes, as well the constant preaching and virtue signalling. We go to the cinema to be entertained, to be taken out of our mundane day to day life, and strapped into a roller-coaster ride of entertainment and fun.

The success of this movie and Top Gun Maverick, combined with the embarrassing failures of Disney, should hopefully see a shift back to traditional film making and storytelling. Green screen be gone! We want a good plot, character building, and to actually care about what happens to these people. If you define a character by their outward identity first, then you've lost the audience already.

Now if you've seen the last 3 John Wick movies, you know what to expect. But take that, and dial it up to 11. The fight scenes are amazing, one scene where we get an aerial view is like combining the best action from both movies and video games. I've never seen it so well done, and you'll be gasping at how cool it is.

Kudos to Mr Reeves for his ageless virility. Hiroyuki Sanada brings his usual presence and dominates the screen, Bill Skarsg√•rd is a good Bond type villian, and Fishburne and McShane bring things up a notch with excellent performances. But Donnie Yen is the star, he steals every scene he is in. His fight scenes are the best ones, and he has some great dialogue as well. You really feel for Caine, he seems to have lost as much as John Wick as.

I highly recommend you go give this a watch, it's a movie that reminds you what going to the cinema is all about.",9
whatgift,"While there is tons of style and brilliantly staged fight scenes, the first two hours drags on - it's either fight scenes we've seen in past JW movies, or hideously long exposition scenes that feel like they're going in slow motion.

It's the final act that really shines, showing some new fight locations and choreography, setting a new high bar for action scenes and cinematography. While there is quite a bit of CGI enhancement, it doesn't detract from the live action which feels very fresh and visceral.

It's a shame that the JW movies are getting longer, since the extra runtime in subsequent movies has not added any depth or more excitement than the first - more is not necessarily better.",7
Pairic,"John Wick: Chapter 4: These aren;t fights, rather ballets are being played out as John Wick (Keanu Reeves) and his friends fight off legions of attackers. Set piece battles take place in a hotel, a disco and in the traffic next to the Arc de Triomphe. The Triomphe sequence is perhaps the best as Wick has to dodge cars as well as waves of attackers sent out by the Table and attracted by the ever increasing bounty on his head. Wick is even half hanged in a Russian Orthodox Church in Berlin. Family, friendship and the comradeship forged in battle is important here, ties which have weakened must be rebuilt. Caine (Donnie Yen) is a blind assassin and old friend of Wick who is now forced to pursue him, A new bounty hunter, The Tracker (Shamier Anderson) complete with cute German shepherd (dog) is also on his trail. Most fearsome of his foes is the Marquis (Bill Skarsg√•rd) who dispossesses Winston Scott Ian McShane and destroys his hotel. This is a dark tale, while the sheer number of deaths may appear comedic the means by which they are killed and the graphically displayed aftermath will choke the laughter in your throat. But it's not just an action thriller, there are shades of paranoic conspiracy and existential terror which infuse this film. Some pretty good acting from Reeves, Yen and the ensemble cast. DDrected by Chad Stahelski and written by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch. 8/10.",8
mason25,"As per title. It was good, almost great, but a lot of small issues add up to the movie having larger issues.

I don't care what kind of dance club you're in, if you see people being shot, shooting in general, you're not going to continue dancing right next to them, you just aren't.

Only after 15 minutes of multi level shooting does anyone even try to run away....

Ditto for the cars at the Arc de triumph (sp), yes some cars will for sure just continue on with their night, not those that have had bodies slammed in to them or through the windshields. I'll even concede that no one should want to stick around given the shooting, but it would be swarmed with police rather quicker than 20 minutes.

Not specific to this film, but it is overtly noticeable because it is such an action heavy movie, any time there is more than 1 or 2 guys attacking John, there's ALWAYS people noticeably just ""waiting their turn to die"" as per the script.

In JW3 it was the Asian guys that gave him a chance to stand up and fight fairly, the second guy was always just sort of waiting or rolling around needlessly. Same thing in this movie.

Also, if no one is scared of the cops showing up, you can't tell me that a dozen or more guys haven't been honing their rifle skills to shoot their targets at a distance of more than hugging.

Despite the complaints above, it was still a good movie, definitely did not feel like 3 hours, and I'll gladly add it to the movie collection.",7
cgvsluis,"John Wick and all of the franchise colorful characters are back...with a few newbies. This film starts right where the last one ends, The High Table sends the Marquis to punish Winston at the New York branch for helping John Wick...this results in The Consierge Charon being killed and the hotel being blown up. The only way back is to team up with John Wick again. In his quest to get out, Wick has to challenge the Marquis through the High Table setting up an eventual Old West style dual.

Before the dual can happen...Wick has to get a voice to challenge the High Table through his Russian family, requiring a seemingly impossible job, and of course he has to get to the dual site.

This brings back the radio oddsmaker ladies, whose on-air spokes-personality is always teasingly tantalizing!

The sheer number of stunts in this film make this a must see. In the quest to get to the location of the dual...Wick must fight a literal up hill battle.

If the number of stunts isn't enough to convince you to see this film, there is also the amazing international backdrop which is stunning by itself. Modern, sleek and visually appealing there is a lot of eye candy to enjoy. One teaser, there is a new character called The Tracker who brings a new dog to the John Wick story.",8
juliancamilleri-61595,"Can't say I was intrigued by the story, no real twists and frankly boring. - The fights quality are quite on the lower end.of.the spectrum and doesn't really stand out.

The movie didnt contain any storyline that will.captovate one, its fairly predictable from the start, there are a few exceptions throughout the film were one would be intrigued, but the movie itself seems to be a low budget movie with very low quality stunts.

I wouldn't recommend the movie, even the cinema was fairly small, since not many are attending to watch.

ColeHutton,"John Wick 4 was everything you come to expect from a Wick movie and more. It was awesome. The kills were brutal and the choreography was amazing. The scene with the shotgun was 10/10. That long shot was probably my favorite Wick scene to date. The ending of the movie was perfect. I couldn't think of a more fitting end to the story. John Wick has planted itself as one of the greatest action franchises of all time. Each movie is better than the last, and the story never manages to lose control. I always expect the movies to fall off at some point, but they simply don't. These movies are fun, violent, and actually tell a great story.",9
redcanofevil,"A very different kind of JOHN WICK film that has equal amount of hits as it has misses. As someone who wasnt much of a fan of Chapter-3 this addresses none of my gripes. Too many characters, too many rules/norms/High-table bs, too many bullet sponge cartoonish mob fight, indestructible superhumans and John Wick himself being a cardboard cut-out parody version of himself. I mean yeah it has some cool actions scenes, especially the Hotline-Miami esque topdown shooting sequence and almost every scene with Donnie Yen but does it erase all the overkills? What made the first 2 films so great was that JOHN WICK actually felt like a human, had emotions. Now its just using the suit as a shield and walk away with literally anything. Also for a movie with action legends like SANADA-SAN, DONNIE YEN, KEANU REEVES there was barely any worthwhile action, I just wanted a showdown with each of them in their prime but the movie infuriatingly shies away from that. For what its worth atleast I'm glad more people are gonna discover RINA SAWAYAMA, she's an amazing artist and got to flaunt her fighting chops as well.",8

Sparse on dialog and heavy (and I mean HEAVY) on action, this movie, if it does nothing else, raises the bar for future action films to a Mount Everest level. It would be absurd in the extreme if it wasn't done so artfully.

In an age of CGI cheats and costumed tomfoolery, JW4 is a breath of fresh air. The action, while highly stylized, is tactile. The characters are operatic archetypes who inhabit the constant chaos as if it were normal. Every single aspect of this film shows a total and complete commitment to craft and care. This is no simple money grab or milking a dry teat (I'm looking at you Disney). This is a passion project and the result is a film that earns every single minute of its 169 minute runtime.",7
moviemanmo,"John Wick is easily one of the best franchises ever and this movie just adds to how true that is. The use of lights and colors make virtually every scene a picture perfect shot. There's not a single dull moment. Although the fight scenes are amazing, there are scenes where it looks like the attackers are waiting their turn. The use of different weapons is really cool and the main characters all have their weapon of choice.

Caine (Donnie Yen) is easily my favorite character in this movie and he steals the show with his action sequences. I can see why people would complain about a blind man fighting like ""Daredevil"" in a world that is supposed to be realistic. But I still enjoyed the action and his character. Overall, everyone in this movie is solid. The character of ""Mr. Nobody/the tracker"" was the only person I felt could have been improved upon. He was only like-able because he had a dog and his action sequences were the same as what Halle Berry did in the last film.

The dialogue is limited but it delivers what it needed to carry the plot. The sprinkle of humor is just the right amount for this type of movie. Although I think John Wick falling down a crazy amount of stairs wasn't meant to be funny but was ridiculously so. As to not spoil the ending, I will say it could have been more dramatic.",9
angelosbitoratos,"Coming in the 4 installment of the John Wick series with everything that has happened in the previous 3 I was wondering what was going to happen in this one. And boy it was magnificent. Keanu Reeves had already solidified himself as a legend through the Matrix series but with the conclusion of this movie he overcame whatever he did while acting as Neo. The choreography was the best I've ever seen in any action movie and it never felt boring. For a movie almost 3 hours long it never got boring you were always hyped up about what's going to happen next. The camera work was phenomenal following Wick to iconic places such as Japan, Sahara Desert(probably),Paris,Berlin,New York etc. But what I really appreciated about this movie was that despite having less dialogue than action you really had feelings about the other characters than John. Caine's character (Donnie Yen) was tremendous at his job. He made himself a believable blind men without making his character such as Daredevil. When you first saw you him you instantly hated him but with the movie progressing you started to like him. Marquis (Bill Skasgard) gave you the vibe of a hateful villain from the start and keeping that vibe irritating you through the whole movie. The tracker (Shamier Anderson) was a fun character also being more a anti-hero than a villain giving us memories from the first John Wick with his dog. And the comeback of some iconic characters such as Charon,Winston and King. And in the end a very sad but also nice conclusion with the villain ending up dead Caine and his daughter being saved and John finally resting joining his wife in the afterlife and making himself the name of the most notorious person in the underworld. The Babayaga!

And movie to be remembered through the years.",9
patskatsy,"The best thing about John Wick 4 is that they show you too much without showing you too much. Lots of fight scenes, action, guns and bullets make this movie one of the best action movies of all time. The plot as always is simple and action gets most of the praise.

But for me this movie isn't just about the action. It's about how they adapt in each environment. From Japan to USA. The movie is shot really well and that helps making the action even more entertaining.

And John, what can I say about him? Keanu does an amazing job playing the killer we all love. His determination to finally free himself is what makes him so good in this movie.

There are a lot of things about this movie that I could praise on an on but it isn't really worth it. You just have to watch and enjoy it yourself

Yeah,",9
UnderTheScene,"If you are a fan of action films then this is a must watch. For story- John Wick Chapter 4 does not satisfy. I feel like they threw out the idea of a story ever since the first film and have just produced more action sequences with every film. I'm not complaining about that until I noticed a lot of scenes become unrealistic to the point it looks bad. The Bulletproof suits really become over used and make you feel like there is no point for guns in these films anymore. However, with some very interesting cinematography and entertaining scenes I had to give this film an 8/10 or 4/5 for overall enjoyment and entertainment, but proved the franchise did not need to expand this far.",8
erkarhu,"I was really excited about this movie since it had such good reviews in here. Now I know that I won't be trusting any IMDB reviews ever again - So far the worst movie I've ever seen.

I can't believe they managed to stretch 20 minutes script into 3 hours. Plot didn't move forward at all. Fighting scenes were EXTREMELY long and unrealistic. Acting was poor and hard to watch. Dialogues that were apparently meant to be ¬´ funny ¬ª were the corniest I've ever heard.

To be honest I would watch Shark Tornado or Twilight rather that this.

Do yourself a favor and use your spear 3 hours to something else. This wasn't worth of the money or the time.",1
RightOnDaddio,"The late Richard Marcinko, first commanding officer of SEAL Team Six and author, often wrote of how Mr. Murphy of Murphy's Law would often appear during missions and wreak havoc on a finely planned operation.

In these John Wick movies, which I do enjoy, Mr. Murphy never seems to actually show, All of the hand to hand combat scenes, the combatants are in sequential agreement in their movements. It looks awesome, it flows on screen for sure, but it's not realistic.

This series has always required a suspension of disbelief. This movie even more so.

At some point John Wick, as if injected now with the blood of Michael Myers in that he has become virtually indestructible.

In this chapter he endures and withstands the impossible. Not even suffering the slightest sprain, or pulled muscle, much less a broken bone.

And now we have Kevlar suits which apparently can stop anything and everything and do.

But what am I saying?

John Wick fans know this. They know all of this.

So, this movie gets an 8?

Yes, because it's John Wick and we love it all no matter what.

The glorious international settings. The gorgeous mens suits.

The dastardly villains aplenty.

Killa played by Scott Adkins is one of my all time faves in this series. An over-the-top, oversized, good toothed comic book-type baddie. He dominates every scene he's in.

Even as hundreds, maybe even thousands of clubbers get down around he and Wick like it's the mid-90's in some multilevel discotheque thumping away to those bass beats.

The suits. The sets. The beats. The beatdowns. And Clancy Brown. It's great to see him here too as the Harbinger.

That's why this film gets an 8. It's a total 8. Is it long? Yes. Does it seem long? No.

But there is an end scene. A very important one. Stick around for it.",8
vishnu_valsalan,"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) critical review

John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) is the latest and possibly the best entry in the action franchise that stars Keanu Reeves as a legendary assassin who defies a powerful criminal organization known as The High Table. The film delivers on its promise of epic wall-to-wall action, with stunning choreography, inventive set pieces, and brutal violence. But it also offers more than just mindless spectacle, as it explores John Wick's personal journey, his motivations, and his connections with other characters.

The film picks up where John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019) left off, with John being betrayed by Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of The Continental hotel in New York, and thrown off a building. John survives with the help of his old friend Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), who leads a network of underground informants. Together, they decide to wage war against The High Table and its enforcer, The Marquis (Bill Skarsg√•rd), a ruthless and cunning adversary who will stop at nothing to eliminate John Wick.

John travels across the globe to seek allies and resources for his fight, from Berlin to Paris to Tokyo. Along the way, he encounters familiar faces such as Charon (Lance Reddick), Winston's loyal concierge; Sofia (Halle Berry), a former colleague who owes him a favor; and Zero (Mark Dacascos), a former rival who respects him. He also meets new allies such as Doc Q (Donnie Yen), an old friend from his past; Kazuya (Hiroyuki Sanada), a Japanese crime lord who has a history with John; and Akane (Rina Sawayama), Kazuya's daughter and prot√©g√©.

The film is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has helmed all four John Wick films so far. He brings his expertise in stunt coordination and martial arts to create some of the most impressive action sequences ever seen on screen. The film features a variety of styles and weapons, from hand-to-hand combat to gunfights to sword fights to car chases. The film also pays homage to classic action films such as The Matrix trilogy (which also starred Reeves and Fishburne) and Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2.

The film is not without its flaws, however. Some may find the plot too thin or convoluted, or the dialogue too cheesy or exposition-heavy. Some may also find the violence too excessive or gratuitous, or the tone too dark or grim. The film also runs for almost three hours, which may test some viewers' patience or attention span.

Nevertheless, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to one of the most successful action franchises of all time. It showcases Keanu Reeves' charisma and commitment as an actor and an action star. It also expands on the rich mythology and world-building of the John Wick universe. It is a must-watch for fans of action cinema and for anyone who enjoys watching Keanu Reeves kick ass.",8
rdscreations,"This movie ll go down in history as one of the best action movies. The Immortal Baba yaga is back to get his freedom back and ready to kill anybody coming his way. With the addition of new characters, there is no way this franchise is going to end with this film. This movie has raised the bar in all technical aspects whether it's sound design, cinematography, editing, production design. Overall, it's a must watch for action fans. Watch it in biggest screen possible with Dolby sound. The very first scene will make your heart thumping. Donnie yen excels in all the scenes he features. All characters played their part well. Just go and watch this once in lifetime experience.",10
exceladeogun,"John Wick: Chapter 4

Off the heels of the third movie, this instalment lives up to the big, bad and bold action that the franchise is known for.

The action scenes are creative and shot beautifully, with the aerial one-shot scene being one of the most thrilling action scenes in cinema history.

Keanu Reeves delivers an expected splendid performance once again, Donnie Yen shines brilliantly as John Wick's friend and adversary by circumstance (it's very easy to root for him even though it's a John Wick movie), and Rina Sawayama is fantastic in her big screen debut. Bill Skarsgard is also a good villain.

The plethora of locations employed is breathtaking, and the cinematography is outstanding. The soundtrack also complements the visuals adequately.

The most noticeable problem with this instalment is its runtime. At two hours and 49 minutes, it's overstuffed with drawled-out action sequences. With the John Wick franchise, suspending one's disbelief is pivotal, but this instalment takes things beyond. It's hard to believe the plausibility of partygoers dancing gleefully as people are being shot and axed. John Wick's immunity to damage was also taken too far.

In all, lovers of the previous instalments would also love this one.

7-7.5/10.",7
nunonegro,"Let me start by telling you this: spectacular scenes, great outfits, amazing pictures. This is what this movie has to offer.

The rest? Not so much. Too much fighting scenes , not believable, not relatable, not even to the point of character development or changing throughout the movie.

Lots of expected scenes (my friend even guested the final scenes, not being a bit surprised)

Even the plot is striped down, super simple to guess. The dialogues are blanked, you could watch this movie without any dialogue and 90% of it would make sense.

Not much of lines to memorize, to make memes, to take to your life. Some friends of mine went to watch this movie, not even a Instagram story, not even discussing the movie in the end.

Oh, and it has a post credits scene, of about 15 seconds. Not much, but take that information with you (because most of the room had already left the theater)",5
dockie-94105,"Incredible action choreography, stunt work, locations, set designs, costumes and action sequences. I was laughing in amazement at good they were!!!

It had every kind of action fight scene possible including a horse chase. Would the Academy just give them all Oscars right now? I was just wondering why we hadn't seen the mandatory stereotypical car chase scene when it started. Awesome. Loved that they continued the tradition with the dog. Great casting. New actress Rina was very good. I will always remember her fight scene with the big guy. Keanu Reeves is such a bad actor it's incredible. Thankfully, he only had to say one sentence every half hour. He almost makes me believes he can toss bigger younger stronger henchmen around but the other actors totally made me believe it. Donnie Yen...wow. Scene with Scott Adkins...wow. Sanada...wow. The movie went too far in making Wick indestructible...come on! Loved other characters scenes..welcome back McShane and Fishbourne. Can't decide if I liked new villain...the Marquise. If it wasn't for the dazzling suits and set locations for him I think I would have gone...meh! I loved how he ended. Two points off for Keanu Reeves himself and the writers making him impervious to harm, pain, exhaustion and common sense.",8
sufyaanrashid95,"""John Wick Chapter 4"" is a highly anticipated addition to the popular franchise, and it does not disappoint. As a fan of the previous movies, I was excited to see where the story would go next, and I was not disappointed.

The movie is filled with the intense action and stylish fight scenes that fans have come to expect from the John Wick franchise. The fight choreography is impressive and the action sequences are executed flawlessly. The cinematography is also stunning, with beautiful locations and creative camera work that adds to the overall experience.

Aside from the action, the movie also delves deeper into the world of assassins and the complex relationships between the characters. The plot is engaging and keeps you guessing until the end, with plenty of twists and turns to keep things interesting.

One of the standout features of ""John Wick Chapter 4"" is the cast. Keanu Reeves once again delivers a fantastic performance as the titular character, and he is joined by an impressive ensemble cast that includes new additions like Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada.

Overall, ""John Wick Chapter 4"" is a thrilling addition to the franchise that will leave fans satisfied and excited for what's to come. It delivers on the action and expands on the world and characters in interesting ways. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the franchise or just looking for a great action movie, ""John Wick Chapter 4"" is definitely worth watching.",8
SPZMaxinema,"This is easily the best John Wick out of all of them and one of the best action movies of the decade so far. When I saw this movie, the theater was packed and it deserved to be. The John Wick franchise and Keanu Reeves literally bring people together and action like this is what we need in our movies, real stunts on camera with real effort and without needless CGI! Donnie Yen killed it in his role and there are fantastic sequences that blew me away (the stairs scene, the Paris traffic scene around the Arc De Triomphe, and the ending duel specifically). The wet night club fight and the fancy Japanese hotel scene were astounding as well, and throw in the humor and the dog as the two cherries on top. Take notes Hollywood! And huge shoutout to Keanu Reeves for doing stunts and work like this at his age still, he's just as impressive as Tom Cruise!",9
movies_are_life_,"John Wick 1-3 made everyone always ask how the next one could top this one. Not only have the films created longer, more unique, and brutal action scenes, but they have increasingly developed the John Wick world. The audience showing their love for the unrealistic has propelled the franchise to lean more towards the absurdity, and deepening the John Wick world into that where normality in John Wick 4 is impossible in the real world.

Approaching the 4th chapter, you have to accept the rules in the John Wick world, not as faults in the screenplay, but as a necessary characteristic of storytelling that supports the extensive action scenes that we come to expect. John Wick 4's success is measured in how it succeeds with what it wants to fulfill for the audience, which is a stunning visual/auditory experience mixed with extended fun action scenes. The story between action is more about using characters and their methodology to expand your knowledge of this world. Sure, John has a goal, but it's purposely 3rd nature as it more or less is shaped by others around him.

None of the movies have cared much about a deep story. John Wick 4 carries this tradition as well as seeing if it can succeed by moving the goal posts to see how far they can take the action. The lengthy run time flies by, thereby exemplifies how well the film succeeds with the action. It answers the question how could the other movies be topped. Now, how can John Wick 4 be topped?",9
eva3si0n,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is a vivid example of how to regain confidence in the series. John Wick: Chapter 4 is an illustrative work on your mistakes. Part 3 raised a lot of questions and had many illogical events. Part 4 compensates for all this. John Wick: Chapter 4 is a good finish to the franchise. All storylines are completed, the main character's goal has been achieved. But unfortunately, most likely there will be part 5 with the continuation of the story and it will clearly no longer be able to reach the level with John Wick: Chapter 4. In 4 parts there are some of the best action scenes, they are performed at the level of part 2. The final scene with a long staircase turned out to be excellent, a vivid example of how to make an action scene both memorable and a meme. I'm glad that the series did not go downhill, but again gave out perhaps the best action movie of the year.",9
saptesh786,"Just saw 4th installment of much talked and long time waited with eager and high expectations but I disappointed while watching. Last action scene is not impressive seems only for repeated for John Wick. Final climax is interested and watchable.

Acting Kanu Reaves is looking aged and tired. Donnie Yen, Laurence Fishburn, Issac Mc, Riddick interesting. Surprise is Scott Adkins. He is looking very different apart from his macho image. High table and it's rules are not new we already seen previously. Here only locations different and authorised persons changed.

Overall movie is watchable once.

It is my first movie after two and half years due to my illness.",7
Anurag-Shetty,"John Wick: Chapter 4 continues with the story of John Wick(Keanu Reeves), after the events of John Wick(2014), John Wick: Chapter 2(2017) & John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum(2019). John discovers a way to defeat The High Table. However, to walk away from his old life, he has to square off against a sinister new enemy, with strong alliances worldwide & forces that turn former allies into enemies.

John Wick: Chapter 4 is an awe-inspiring film. Director Chad Stahelski can do no wrong with the John Wick franchise & has knocked it out of the park, yet again. The action set pieces are mind-blowing & the best of the franchise, so far. Hats off to the stunt team for intricately crafting each action sequence. Keanu Reeves is spectacular as John Wick. Laurence Fishburne is superb as Bowery King. Donnie Yen is outstanding as Caine. Bill Skarsgard is fantastic as Marquis. Ian McShane is great as Winston. Hiroyuki Sanada is brilliant as Shimazu. The supporting cast is excellent. John Wick: Chapter 4 is a must watch for fans of the John Wick franchise.

jtoproductionsphoto,"I love the lore and the franchise, but this movie dragged on for way too long. The sets and cast are amazing, but honestly you can only watch some one do pistol shots for so long till it gets repetitive and boring. I loved one and 2 and re watched them a lot, 3 I only re watched once cause it got tiresome and 4 definitely was way to long and repetitive. Massive fan of the lore wish there was more instead we get almost 3 hours of Keanu beating a dead horse.

There is no sense of time in this movie or situational awareness. He just teleports where ever part of the world he needs to be with out injury after falling out of buildings and hit by cars. The people in the world just continue on while people are getting shot and hacked to death in front of them at night clubs or on the streets. People eating on patios as a shootout happens. So much things made this movie so dumb.

I hope they don't milk this franchise and make it like the fast and furious franchise where all of a sudden logic goes out the window and they all suddenly have super powers. The blind assassin is such a cool concept maybe in a different time frame, but you're telling me in a world of professional hitmen with guns and explosives a blind guy is the deadliest amongst them. I'm an average joe and I can kill that assassin he not dodging a full clip from an AR 15 and a few grenades...

All in all for action it was amazing as long as you go to enjoy and turn of your brain. The lore is awesome, but the rules are just stupid or do not apply to John himself. Ticket torn cant go home gets back home under the high table for doing what... killing one fat guy... Yet his original story is suppose to be epic what he did that night to get out of the underworld bla bla bla. Nothing the characters did had any weight t consequences of anything in and outside the table. I think they just over thought this universe a little too hard.",5
scorp76,"Only 2 good boss fight scenes and they were not the main boss or the 2nd main boss. There is boss fight between two sub-bosses there is so out of character of the character development created for them just before the fight that it spoils the special ending.

Endless mob grinding while spamming potions and abilities. If you play any MOBA games you will understand. Magic jacket need magic weapons of +5 or higher to hit (AD&D reference). Only armour thicker than his jacket is his plot armour.

Bad plot writing, b grade action movie ending, c grade special ending. Bad directing, bad pacing of mob clearing, bad cinemography. I joked with my friend that they will try pad out the movie with 5 minute scene of people eating or siting. There were 3 definite moments of these of which when they start he couldn't stop laughing looking at me.

The actually padding out of a movie that would be at most 1 hour and 40 minutes long was done with the mob grinding scenes. You see John take his cosmos pistol (a gun with endless bullets, Captain Harlock reference) when plot requires him to toss it use his character hot bar skill to obtain another one.

There is feeling of risk even when John gets visibly tired, he just hot bars his stamina potion and is good to go.

Pros: Donnie Yen total character commitment in center and off frame of his scenes. He has total commitment to playing a blind person and not some blind kung fu master. You will see him in the side frame continuously shooting in the general direction of an enemy he kills because he doesn't know if he went down and is dead or is touching and tapping with his sword the environment as he moves to make sure of his surroundings. He even sometimes looks the wrong in side frame when people are talking because he is not Dare Devil.",6
makavelix5,"When there's action and there's a lot, it's a masterpiece. When there's no action, it's some nonsense dialogs, stup1d games and bad actings.

When there's no action, they play cards...CARDS! And for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. And at some point, i'm not 100% sure but they played ''Magic Card'' game?

The other negative thing is they are FRIENDS and ENEMIES and FRIENDS again and then ENEMIES AGAIN and nobody is surprised by that. The ''king'' who played by Lawrance F. Did literally nothing. I guess he was just a Tailor. The dialogs were nonsense. I don't even know why John didn't have any grudge over Winston. Anyways.. The Japanese woman who has a ''anime'' black suit can't act. She was horrible. How did she even got a chance to be on same set with Keanu Reeves? Maybe she's someone's cousin or a rockstar that i donno. Blind man didn't make sense but ok it was cool. The Japanese pride/respect things were super anime-ish and didn't work at all.

I also don't get the part of GLANCE each other first before shooting each other. And nobody runs away even when they got hit or hurt. Well i'm just glad they didn't go with ''Your wife is actually alive'' thing.

But it is an 8/10 movie and as a package it is 9/10 series. It is one of those ''watch before you die''.",9
chantalafreniere,"Really? Is John Wick invincible? Has he gain superhero power while he recovered from his (mortal) fall at the end of chapter 3?

He also falls in those infinite stairs, but still doesn't have a bruise.

What about that dog made of steel! He to has been hit by a car and goes his way like nothing happens.

The real John Wick would have shoot the guy with the golden tooths WHILE playing poker.

And... were the artistic director and the director on drugs when they filmed that movie? Every scene is ¬´ beautiful ¬ª. - I want a battle in the rain. The effect of water falling everywhere will be so amazing. - I have a better idea! Let's make a waterfall IN a bar and everybody will continue to dance even if it's shooting everywhere around them!

HuzeFostage,"John Wick 4 just feels like ""even bigger and better"" but really not executed that well.

The scale these movies have grown to is just too much for me at this point.

The blind character's fighting is the most believable part of this movie.

There is a massive shootout in the middle of paris without any authorities arriving in over 10 minutes.

A 30min. Chapter that takes part in Berlin is possibly the worst these movies have ever been featuring terrible slow motion combat and comic relief bad guys - By the way, the main antagonist is also increadibly one dimensional.

The conclusion was done rather well though. After 2+ hours I surely didnt expect 2 of the best fight scenes in recent memory (The shotgun rampage and stairway fight using a Justice song).

The ending was just what it needed to be without being too dragged out.

I didn't even notice the music most of the time besides of what I mentioned above. While John Wick 1 & 2 used original Music and had a great OST everything here is either reused or straight up licensed.

Overall I think the other JW films did their thing better than this one but the action is obviously superb. Just don't expect anything else like I did.",6
Silicone54,"I couldn't wait for this to come out but I was quickly reminded why the first one was and always will be the best. This might have been the worst of the 4 movies.

John Wick's legend and mystery has been reduced to a long series of fight scenes. While impressive they were just adrenaline dumps. Once the pace calms down you realize there is no substance here.

John Wick wants out and they won't allow it. Literally the same plot since the first movie. I would have preferred a backstory of John WIck becoming the Baba Yaga that has people shaking in their boots. The end of the series should be either he dies or he dismantles the whole organization. Instead this movie leaves it open for another paycheck in case Keanu wants another shot.

Definitely recommend this for fans but it may fall a bit flat if you expected a blockbuster.",7
behdadba-80814,"John Wick: Chapter 4 takes audiences on another exhilarating ride through the gritty and high-octane world of everyone's favorite unstoppable assassin. Picking up where its predecessor left off, this installment dives deeper into the complex mythology surrounding the enigmatic hitman known as John Wick, brilliantly portrayed once again by Keanu Reeves.

From the very beginning, the film grips you with its visually stunning and meticulously choreographed action sequences. The fight scenes are a masterclass in precision and brutality, showcasing the sheer dedication and skill of the cast and stunt team. Each punch, kick, and gunshot is flawlessly executed, leaving you on the edge of your seat in awe.

What sets John Wick: Chapter 4 apart from its predecessors is its expanded world-building. The film delves into the secret societies and shadowy underworld that exists beneath the surface of society. It unravels a labyrinthine web of alliances, betrayals, and hidden agendas, introducing intriguing new characters along the way. The screenplay skillfully weaves these narrative threads together, keeping the audience engaged and hungry for more.

Keanu Reeves once again proves why he is the perfect embodiment of John Wick. With his intense physicality and understated charisma, he effortlessly commands the screen, portraying the tormented assassin with depth and conviction. The supporting cast, including standout performances by Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne, adds layers of intrigue and gravitas to the story.

The film's visual aesthetic is a treat for the eyes. The cinematography captures the dark and moody atmosphere of the underworld, juxtaposing it with breathtaking set pieces and stunning locations. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI enhances the authenticity of the action sequences, creating a visceral and immersive experience.

While the film excels in action and world-building, some moments could have benefitted from more exploration. Certain characters and subplots feel underdeveloped, leaving you craving for further depth and backstory. Additionally, the breakneck pace of the narrative at times leaves little room for emotional resonance, with the focus primarily on adrenaline-fueled thrills.

In conclusion, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a worthy addition to the franchise, delivering the pulse-pounding action and captivating storytelling that fans have come to expect. With its stunning visuals, stellar performances, and expanded lore, it leaves you eagerly anticipating the next chapter. While not without minor flaws, it continues to solidify John Wick's status as one of the most thrilling and stylish action franchises of our time.",8
ucgordon,"""John Wick Chapter 4: Baba Yaga"" is pretentious, plodding, padded (at least an hour too long); the director seems to have thought that ""even more"" was ""even better"" after Chapter 3; I admit it is dark, cynical, stylish, grim, and sad - Wick causes death and destruction wherever he goes (robotically and almost unkillable, like a Terminator), even to allies and friends.

Here everything is given. We find multiple recognizable figures that contribute not only from the physical point of view but also from an acting point of view. I must highlight the always correct Fishburne and McShane and the always nice Clancy Brown; However, the one who steals the film is the enormous Scott Adkins who can finally demonstrate in the big cinema what he is capable of. There are multiple plot lines (some more interesting than others), necessary tragedies for the progress of the plot, exuberant and often implausible physical display, and the magnet of having most of the great international action movie stars before us. The fact that the beauty of the locations impacts is based on the fact that if you want to give class to a film then you have to resort to that visual enjoyment that only places with history can offer. The movie pays homage to Peckimpah, Leone and many others who delivered the best movies for our pleasure. Well filmed, with careful shots, it is an enjoyment that is appreciated.",9
sikandar-92597,Although it's a decent movie but far from a reality that a man in his 40 can have so much stemina to fight almost every single man on his way to freedom. Maybe he was on Redbull all the time. He was missing shots in the clear desert area but was accurate when it comes to a crowded club. Apart from him no one was capable to shoot accurately the whole time like a bollywood movie. Hand to hand fighting scenes are repeated. After leaving the theater I didn't feel anything for the movie. Director seemed to be racist as he shown all the whites were enemies for wick and at the End a Chinese guy and two black guys on his sidewould say it's decent remake of any advanced video game.,6
ta-98251,"I'm not a hardcore fan of the John Wick series but I've seen them all. John Wick 4 achieves the difficult feat of being the best entry in the series, four films deep.

The action is taken up to another level, the world expanded and best of all for me, we get a number of really interesting side characters who are unique in their own right. This all means that you feel immersed into the world of John Wick and the High Table.

You do need to suspend belief whilst watching John Wick. He's almost at superhero levels and it feels like John Wick could give Neo a run for his money at this point. There were some sequences that made me think his character was invincible despite the filmmakers doing their best to shown his vulnerabilities.

That being said, you know what you are getting when you watch John Wick. That action is intense, visually stunning and team pulled out some unique sequences. I didn't feel the almost three hour run time. This will be a delightful watch for action and John Wick fans.",7
lstamellos,"The end of the tetralogy is certainly below the bar set by the three previous films.

While the ther films offered pure entertainment, combining spectacle, drama, awe and generous amounts of smart humour, Chapter 4 gives the general impression that was filmed only to close the story with a big bang that at the end wasn't even there.

Even the main characters are differently depicted, arguably shallower than they were. One would argue that the actors just wanted to get over with it and move on.

The finale falls short in achieving the same level of world building, storytelling, spectacular scenes, and emotional portaits of the main characters.

Somewhat fun to watch, but not on the same level with the three films that made the franchise loved.",5
CANpatbuck3664,"What makes John Wick standout in a pretty crowded genre is the action choreography, the grittiness of the action and John's sheer force of will to eliminate every other guy in his way. We get the required goods here, Donnie Yen's addition to the cast also adds to the experience. He not only delivers the choreography but he does it with a flair that stands out (he's also helped along by playing a pretty unique character). There's all the requisite bangs and cracks and it still looks impressive and gives you what you want. (my favourite was the set piece with the birds eye view). The plausible deniability is pulled pretty thin (John Wick is apparently immune to damage after being hit by a car) but it was in the other movies as well, I just noticed it more.

John Wick didn't reintroduce us to Keeanu but it certainly helped catapult him back into the spotlight. John's a quiet character that relies more on his fists and his pistols to flip people to his point of view than his words. He's also an unkillable force of nature but both things are equally true. Keeanu still has the required gravitas to make our brooding master hitman tick and he's consistent with his performance in Chapter 4. Donnie Yen steals the show in my opinion, he's playing a more expressive and off-kilter character and he strikes a nice balance between serious and animated. Ian Mcshane returns as Winston, he's a great performer and he's got a magnetic screen presence. He's a needed anchor for this movie and he helps play up the stakes. Laurence Fishburne returns briefly as the Bowery King, he's doing the same kind of thing but he brings some badly needed levity. It was sad seeing Lance Reddick make his final appearance, he was always an underrated part of this franchise and he will be sorely missed. I wish we had gotten to see more of Rina Sawayama, she was great in her small amount of screen time. Wrapping up with Bill Skarsgard, he's fine as the Marquis but I wish he had been given more to chew on as the villain. He's a really capable actor and while he fits the bill, I couldn't help but feel he could have done more in Chapter 4 to make us really root for John in this battle, but he seemingly lacked the opportunity.

If you're being given a similar flick and you enjoyed the previous entries, you should be satisfied right? I left the theatre content but I was actually a little disappointed. I didn't think there was much new included here or I didn't feel like they did as much to try and raise the bar. I get why Chapter 3 was more contentious film than the previous entries but I'm a little surprised at all the unconditional love Chapter 4 has gotten. To me it felt like just more of the same from Chad Stahelski and his team. It's the same environments, the same kind of characters are introduced and minus a couple of small instances, the same kind of setpieces. Their output is sufficient here but I couldn't help but want more from Chapter 4.

John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers more of the same and if that's what you're primarily interested in, I think you'll leave the theatre satisfied. This is still a solid action movie, but some of the spellbinding affect melted away in this entry for me. The same kind of environments, characters and plot just left me shrugging my shoulders. It's not any better or any worse in almost any respect, I just noticed the machinations behind the curtain more and more. I still would be interested in another movie and hopefully The Continental TV show that's been in development for a while comes out soon. Going ahead, I hope they shake up the bag and bring something new to the mix, they need it more than they realize. Check it out if you're interested but if you haven't jumped on board the franchise's hype train yet, you're okay letting this one go by.",7
Andromeda4482,"You already know how it is. Four movies, roughly 10 hours of watching people die and somehow it all lead up to this. Incredible world building, compounded by brilliant choreography, acting and script writing.

Every scene looks hyper real. Every gun shot, every punch, it's an art form. John Wick 4 neatly wraps up and incredible journey I didn't expect to go on. But I'm greatful I did.

It's the Die Hard of my generation and it's learned and matured so well. It's a visual spectical and I could watch it again and again. For me its a great start to cinema in 2023. It's got me excited for the next films I intend to see (Openheiner and MI).

Go see this movie and don't make the mistake I did, stay for the final scene after the credits!",9
daisukereds,"As a project that started as a gig for those underpaid and overworked, and the charming Keanue Reaves.. it would be unwise for anyone to hope for this to fail. Still, I'm quite surprise with the turn-up.

This is an Action movie foremost, with great lighting, great locations and excellent camera work. And more importantly, a real desire to entertain and indulge anyone interested in the genre. The choreography and planning must have been an undertaking, and is great for the most part.. as I feel suffers a bit when Keanu is on screen and as a whole! Specially as it gets a bit repetitive and exhausting with it's length, as well as when you start noticing Keanue's age as he deals with waves of 2 stunt-men at a time rather.. clumsily. It simply looks bad when 2 suits come in, and then 2 armored soldiers, and then 2 suits again and again.

The movie seems to be tailored for other characters on it's way out, instead. Mr. Nobody has his well deserved moments, Donnie is easily the best actor on screen (with the best action and his ever charming presence).. but who is closely followed by another great Skarsg√•rd performance! With a great villain most recent movies would kill for. And I'm a fan of Sanada-san.

Keanue's stunts aside, his dialogue repertoire is also laughable at best. And not just the lines, but his delivery.. All together, makes it hard to invest in a 4th installment (with the previous ones going in circles and ending where they started) that feels tired and offers little I hadn't seen before (over-view camera aside). Personally, I thought it wouldn't hurt to spend SOME time setting-up the impossibility of ""getting out"", and for Wick's character to become a beacon of hope for those that felt trapped in the system they are in.. giving his arc some needed gravitas, weight and meaning behind these actions. Specially with that ending that feels sort of dissatisfactory with it's implications. As it stands, this just feels like doing for doing sake's, with no real thought or meaning behind the senseless killing.

So! My gripe with this final iteration is with the detriment to the character of ""Baba Yaga"", that fails to present himself as a threat and as a lead at this point, as well as the lack of intention to build it up to be something more than just.. action.

In any case, any fan of this kind of excess would be more than pleased!! And a great movie-night out.",6
nizarsalim,"In John Wick: Chapter 4, the performances of the cast, especially the one of Reeves, action scenes, screenplay, direction and filming angles, sound effects, cinematography, story, soundtrack, ending, and tone are all excellent. They are made with all perfection and passion.

Regarding the flaws, what I didn't like in John Wick: Chapter 4 is that in the story, there are some elements that made the story a little bit confusing and the plot missy. Also, I felt that the 169 minutes runtime was a little bit long for the plot.

But these flaws won't prevent me from giving the movie a high score because it is true that it has these two flaws, but at the same time, it has all the excellent features that I talked about above in the beginning of the review. So regarding the score, I gladly give John Wick: Chapter 4 9 out of 10.",9

Last one hour was an edge-of-a-seat thriller.

Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles.

untitledreviewer,"One of the most hyped action movies in an already packed year, John wick 4 had a lot of shoes to fill and a lot of fans to impress. It did all that masterfully but also so much more.

Positives: Just to be very clear, the film has without any single doubt the best action of the entire franchise but definitely you have to believe into the stjnts else definitely Wick should've been killed by the first 30 minutes of the movie by the logic. The film is not just an action fiesta which to be clear the action is monumental good, it also has so much heart and story to it that some of the previous outings in my opinion had less of just makes this film all the more impressive. Keanu reeves for a guy of his age may have just given a peak movie of his entire career and it's some of the absolute best action along with some very impactful story moments such as Wick accepting his life or his reactions which are so perfectly timed they seem so flawless that even some of the modern great films can't compete to except a few.

Negatives: after such a high bar set by John wick 4, it is also easy to notice that some stunts are just so over the top like the action is the greatest in the franchise but the stunts are also the most over the top of the franchise without a doubt. Along with that, I could easily see a better version of Killa not to say the one we got is bad, he's an intimidating fellow with power who's trying to hunt down our main hero and somewhere I see the cause that's driving him but sometimes the cause shouldn't be there. Sometimes you just need that pure evil T-1000 kind of part where even though he looks awesome he's clearly not the good guy, sometimes it's just missed in these kind of franchises.

Conclusion: if they gave us an even reckless villain, this would easily be in my top 5 of favorite action movies of all-time but its still close, because this stuntwork and action is once in a decade level good and im very sure there will hardly be any films that can give the action of this film a run for its money as being the best action work of all-time.",9
BijeshNagesh,"My Impressions:

At almost three hours long, the fourth instalment in the ""John Wick"" franchise looked like it wanted to prove something. But insufficient suspense and oddly edited (for a production like this, anyway) sequences failed to impress. The story did get slightly better, but then again ""Chapter 4"" had an almost three-hour runtime to achieve that.

Countless scenes came across as over-commercialized and over-marketed. It took a lot away from a potentially intriguing storyline. There were more than a few instances when I felt ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" borrowed heavily from action-movie tropes that have since reached their expiration date.

I've long been a fan of Keanu Reeves and the man did not disappoint. His performance as the titular character was the only thing that made this movie compelling. Wick was seeking permanent escape, rather freedom, from the underworld. He was no longer interested in all the backstabbing, treachery, assassination, and espionage. But, leaving his line of work was easier desired than done.

Now we come to the baddies. Villains maketh the hero, as they say. In ""John Wick: Chapter 4"", all the baddies brought their A-game and delivered high-octane excellence. Their respective performances, stunts, and martial arts helped offset the creative limitations I observed in ""Chapter 4"".

Special shout-out to Scott Adkins who was brilliant, and rather under-rated, in the role of Killa. All his scenes were perfection. Much the same could be said for Bill Skarsg√•rd as the Marquis Vincent Bisset de Gramont - including his incredibly natural French accent, sartorial style, and diabolical finesse.

Lance Reddick's presence in this movie made his current absence in our lives (and tinseltown) glaringly apparent. ""Such is life,"" indeed. Rest in power, good sir.

Some of the elements I appreciated in the movie were the bulletproof Kevlar-lined suits, that outstanding Belgian Malinois, the rich d√©cor and outfits on some of the characters (especially the Marquis), and of course everything Keanu Reeves brought to the fourth (and hopefully final) instalment in the ""John Wick"" movie series.

However, unnecessary fluff, unduly dramatic moments, a handful of contrived sequences, and a few discernibly slow stunt movements all weighed the movie down in ways that I, as a fan of this franchise, didn't quite expect.

Some other movies might have gotten away with such shoddy filmmaking, but not in this dojo, not in ""John Wick: Chapter 4"", where the movie's trailers and marketing pitches ended up outshining the final result.

The raison d'etre for some of the fights, including the Parisian traffic tussle did not quite check off all the right logic boxes. Anyway, that fight sequence had its moments. But the overhead single-take shot of Wick escaping through a single-floor apartment complex and his later 222-staircase rendezvous were both *chef's kiss* and expertly choreographed. That sentimental ending was a nice touch. Also, remember to catch that heartbreaking, but rather karmic, ""John Wick 4"" post-credits scene.

Hair-makeup and costume design were admirable. Art direction and set decoration were great. Stunts and VFX were noteworthy. Editing and sound effects were good. Musical scoring was amazing. Cinematography was exceptional. Screenplay was alright. Direction was quite good.",7
dlmiley,"I saw ""John Wick 4"" yesterday. It is more of the same (and much more) from Keanu Reeves as the titular character. It has Mr. Wick flying all over the world encountering numerous villains who have been set upon him by Marquis de Gramont (played by a deliciously evil Bill Skarsgard). The action set pieces are well done and there are plenty of exotic places to feast your eyes upon like the Osaka Continental and a bizarre Berlin nightclub. Plus, there are ingenious ways for a blind nemesis to fight off attackers. The other actors are fine including the usually reliable Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburn and the late Lance Reddick. And Scott Adkins is perfectly awful as the grossly overweight and terrifying villain ""Killa"". Those are the good points, but here are bad points - the movie is overlong at 165 minutes. Many of the fight scenes are repetitive and add nothing to the story except extend the run time. So, I while I enjoyed the movie, it could have been edited down to about the standard 2 hours without damaging the storyline in the slightest. I think the high rating in IMDB is unjustified at 8.4, and I would rate this one at a 7/10.",7

Hey_Harry,"Depending on its theatrical run, John Wick 4 is slated to be the final film in the John Wick franchise. That being said, John Wick: Chapter 4 definitely stands out as the most hard-hitting action film in the series and a satisfying conclusion to one of the best action franchises in recent years. The optimist in me however still hopes there'll be a John Wick 5 or at least a spin-off franchise. The only minor complaint I have is that John Wick 4 doesn't have the same elements of world-building lore that made the previous films so engaging but John Wick 4 more than makes up for it with pure elements of non-stop action and impressive fight choreography which make sure to push Wick to his absolute limit. The action is so intense at times that I was actually felt out of breath while watching Wick battle through multiple waves of minions and assassins. John Wick 4 includes an excellent cast of heroes and villains, including Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins, who are all phenomenal in the film. All of the above deliver a delicious cinematic action feast that you don't want to miss out on while the movie's still in theaters.",10
Youfassa,"John wick: Chapter 4, Looking back at all the previous john wick movies, this chapter in specific is basically all the three previous movies combined times 1.5, 2 hours and 50 minutes of non-stop action sequences from beginning to end with barely any break to catch a breathe in between. Keanu Reeves always ups the level with each iteration with the amount of physical work and training required to be able to do these fight and action scenes alongside the stunts.

Really cool direction and cinematography choices throughout the movie in multiple shots and sceneries.

Bringing back the mid tempo electronic music and the addition of soundtracks never disappoints as a beatboxer/musician.

This movie is adrenaline.",9
patrick-45740,"I loved part 1. Part 2 was also a great movie. Part 3 was questionable at best. They lost me on part 4.

When he is riding a horse in the dessert his aim is even worse than that of a stormtrooper. But when he is driving in circels with one hand (in a car with manual shifting) while shooting out the car his aim is perfect. He can now fall from 4 floors on concrete of break a car in half shake it of and run some more.

Both Keanus lines and the script only take 1 single page. I read he only speaks about 350 words in 3 hours. And most of the are ""Yeau"".

The end is so predictable. I won't spoil it for you but when you watch the movie you will know it in 2 hours.

The accent of the ""Marquis"" is so bad. Go to France and listen to French speaking Englisch/American (if you can find any).

1,5 - 2 hours would be enough. If part 5 comes, i'm not going to the movie theatre to see it. I will download it or wait for Netflix of Prime.",3
movieman6-413-929510,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is the fourth film in the John Wick film series. The film is again directed by Chad Stahelski, who also directed the three previous films.

The price on John Wick (Keanu Reeves) continues to rise, prompting more and more deadly opponents to take on him. As John faces off against these new enemies, he also tries to regain his freedom at The High Table, but this demands a lot from him and he can trust fewer and fewer people.

With this fourth John Wick film, they are going bigger again with more different types of action. For example, this film contains good and different types of action scenes in succession, which they have put together in creative ways. The film can be reminiscent of The Raid action films where you get to see more action than a real story emerges in the film. This is such a fun and entertaining movie for fans of brutal and entertaining action movies. The movie is also set in different places around the world. This way you get to see a beautiful and creative background where the characters compete against each other. Fights take place in an Asian museum, in a dance club and around the Arc de Triomphe.

Due to the long running time and the further lack of a real story, this film sometimes comes across as empty in addition to its action scenes. You learn a little more about the fictional world in which the John Wick films take place, but most of the lines in the films are not always easy to understand. In some scenes where two enemies are together, you don't always understand why they don't kill each other immediately, but take on other opponents first.

At the age of 58, Keanu Reeves still manages to deliver entertaining and believable action sequences. Even when he takes blows, he often still manages to defeat his enemies. He has also done most of his stunts himself and only uses a stuntman when John Wick is hit by an enemy car, for example.

It is also nice to see Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane and Lance Reddick back in their well-known roles from the series. They know how to portray their well-known roles in good and recognizable ways. It's just a pity that Lance Reddick passed away suddenly earlier this month.

Of the many newcomers to the John Wick world, enough know how to steal the film in their moments. Bill Skarsg√•rd plays more of a somewhat corrupt businessman who tries to arrange everything from behind the scenes to deal with John Wick. Shamier Anderson plays more of a mysterious hunter, who neither John Wick nor you as a viewer are ever sure if he can really be trusted.

Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen bring a more Asian fighting culture to the John Wick world. Both portray different Asian fighting styles and cultures in the film. For example, Hiroyuki Sanada plays a more wise, honorable warrior, who knows how to take out his enemies in clever ways. Donnie Yen plays a blind character again, just like he did in the Star Wars Spin-off film Rogue One. Despite this handicap, he again portrays his character in a believable and dangerous way.",7

JellyThyName,"This movie is essentially an over-zealous action montage where a story has been shoved in to excuse the action- the writing even fails at that. The cinematography and stunts are pretty good, especially the birds-eye action sequence.

I feel as though this has been transformed into a fast and furious movie or Tug Speedman's Scorcher series.

Donnie Yen is a fantastic choreographer and to have him blind in this was nonsensical- a jack of all trades blind assassin....

Mr. Nobody could have had more potential instead he has a bit of an identity crisis- it all went down the drain when he wimps out to the Marquis, took away his mysterious badass tracker persona.

What is the point of Morpheus in this? He has had a build up for a while and has now transformed into Johns suit and gun supplier? More wasted potential.

The world building/lore is still very weak- there is so much interesting potential here instead we are just given one liners and are expected to eat it up. Fillers for the next bang bang scene to see John using his trusty suit jacket collar shield.

Clearly, the writers just solely focussed on the action, sure it looks very cool at times but when you show too much of something it takes the magic away. Using the excuse 'this is a john wick movie' is irrelevant, compare this to the first two and think. If you want to hail this as the best action movie ever you may as well hail Fast 9 as the best too, both are akin. All flash, no substance.",5
tudorpenescu,"The fourth installment of the John Wick franchise delivers yet another adrenaline-fueled thrill ride, proving that the series hasn't lost its touch. Keanu Reeves reprises his iconic role as the legendary assassin, bringing his signature charisma and intensity to the screen once more.

John Wick 4 takes the action to new heights, with breathtaking set pieces and meticulously choreographed fight sequences that leave viewers on the edge of their seats. The film's high-stakes plot keeps the momentum going, ensuring that there's never a dull moment in this relentless, action-packed adventure.

The supporting cast brings a fresh dynamic to the franchise, with both new and familiar faces adding depth and intrigue to the story. The cinematography and production design are top-notch, further immersing the audience in the gritty, stylish world of John Wick.

While staying true to its roots, John Wick 4 successfully expands the series' lore, providing fans with more insight into the complex universe of assassins, crime syndicates, and hidden societies. This masterful blend of high-octane action, compelling storytelling, and world-building cements the film as a worthy addition to the beloved franchise.

christopher-j-hughes,"Left after 75mins. First film I've ever walked out of. Just repetitive fighting. Loved the first John wick, had heart and a character you you understand he's motivation. This film however has No plot, thin characters and zero emotional depth. I've had better migraines. The first two minutes tell you everything you need to know about the film. Oi feel sorry for anyone dragged to see it and hasn't seen the other films as you wouldn't have any clue what is going on. Guessing if you play computer games or love guns this is for you.

rockdude-68045,"It's John and he's back for another babayaga action packed movie. From start to finish 80-95% of the movie is straight up action with the rest being scenes with dialogue. This movie delivers what you expect from a john wick film - which is the action packed assassin doing what he does best relentlessly. As a fan to the movies I left the theatres satisfied with my experience knowing that this would be a great ending to the journey (if it really is the last wick movie or not) and that it was worth every penny to see.

Pros:
It john wick. Pure action with amazing choreography as he fights through the underground world of the high table.








Cons:




Overall: John wick 4 was a great addition to the franchise and stay trued to the cinematography, feel, identity, and expectations anyone would have. It delivered and was a great action movie from start to finish. Having to rank the films in an order of preference you'd find this one closer to the top for me personally. I highly recommend watching if your an action fan, looking to see an action movie, or if you want to know the hype of john wick which is very real. 8/10 another wick film that's great!",8
gabriel_sanchez,"By the forth installment, you know what you are in for. Have you gone up to the third movie? You need to watch this one.

If you enjoyed the ride so far, you are going to enjoy this one too. Other than the camera work and the great cinematography, nothing new: John wants to finally see himself free from the assassins' org.

The fight choreographies are great! I feel, from the first installment to Chapter 4, fights got better and better. There is this one scene from above that is just perfect --- you'll know when you see it.

Plot-wise, it's the continuation and might spam into multiple spin-offs. It's the finale, and a great one.

Minor complaint that John, as in all installments, but greatly seen at the third one, takes too much abuse and handles it just fine --- he just limps in pain and that's about it. I guess I'd prefer if it were a tiny bit more realistic.

Overall, as mentioned, if you enjoyed the other installments, you will like this one.",9
wagnernthu,"Loved John Wick 1-3 but even though this one has some highlights it's too much praising weaponry. 3 hours of associating weapons with masculinity and power and the only way to solve problems feels like a movie from the 70ties and not 2023. When Winston gave John Wick the Viper gun it feels like they were looking at a pinup girl the only thing missing was the sliver coming out of his mouth. And of course everyone has a weapon, whole Paris is armed, this is the model. And wait, it's all guys fighting and shooting. Not a single female (except one but the producer decided her main weapon is a sword). The attribute of 'power' is associated with 'men'.

What have we learned from the mass shootings? These dump shooting scenes are just inspiring some loners craving for fame, success and visibility, eventually grabbing daddies firearm to finally feel strong, powerful and manly, aiming for the catastrophe, because they don't know better because nobody educated them better. The endless mass shooting scenes in this movie leave us with a bitter taste in our mouth because the winner is always the hero, the mass shooter. Stop associating weapons with manhood and power and the mains to solve problems. Just stop it. The Wild West had ended. It's 2023. We can do smarter movies and more inspiring movies and teach our children how to solve problems without violence such as civil disobedience or being involved in politics and education.",5
kelboy10,"The opening scene of the forth installment of John Wick delivers an atmospheric tone providing audacity with a beat. This time round John Wick really aims to kill... Kill them all! Laurence Fishburne introduces him coming down the aisle to reach havoc on all who wrongful crossed him! The stakes will often rise with each new release John remains in exhile with very few people he can trust.

The new addition to antagonise Wick played with relentless tenacity is (Bill Skarsgard) Marquis Vincent. With big bewildering eyes alongside subtle movements Skarsgard at times has an animalistic motion, he strikes like a snake without a moments notice! Possibly the best adversary in the franchise so far with a mesmerising showcase of his abilities as an actor.

Much like what made the first movie intriguing this particular outing has character, in fact it has more character than you can shake a web at! From Caine, a charismatic blind man (Donnie Yen) showing us literally his lack of need for a cane as well as providing interesting content; well far more interesting than say Daredevil it seems. To Tracker (Shamier Anderson) a man with a extremely well trained dog; somehow no matter how absurd or ridiculous it all seems it will fit perfectly in a John Wick movie and i must say, is rather entertaining. On top of this, how can we forget Mia (Aimee Kwan) and Akira (Rina Sawayama) bringing some bad arse kicking power to accompany Wick.

This film unlike the last two manages to captures memorable moments from the game of poker to a shoot off in the desert, and capture them well as action escalates up stairs. The action scenes are some of the best around in any film whilst being shot to perfection with regards to camera angles. The birds eye view of destruction was something uniquely and visually stunning. Yes, Chad Stahelski has pushed the boat out here, with a masterclass in how to bring an action movie to life! No matter how far fetched, extreme or blatantly silly things may seem all will go way over your head with nothing except entertainment value! Okay so it might have an excessive runtime time however this is a minor thing as most films appear longer nowadays.",8
gavinp9,"'John Wick: Chapter 4' is perhaps an unexpected fourth film in this franchise, which seems to be getting increasingly longer (2 hours 45min this time), but this film ups the ante on everything. The plot is pretty simple - John (Reeves) wants to stop being hunted by assassins from the ""High Table"", so sets out to kill the Marquis (Skarsgard, dodgy French accent), with some help from Winston (McShane) & Bowery King (Fishburne) as in previous films. Then there's the ambiguous presence of fellow assassins Caine (Yen, great as always) and Nobody (Anderson, good newcomer) who have solid arcs.

It's pretty impressive they've made four of these films in 10 years, when you take covid into account. The film sets the scene a little, then gets right down to business - Wick & his bulletproof suit killing plenty of ""bad guys"". I lost count, but would guess it's over 250 in the entire film, with over 100 to Wick! You pay to see action, and this film certainly delivers. The series now seems to be in a comfortable place with reality suspended - especially the Arc de Triomphe scene. There's a lack of police, the ""magic"" suits, no one shooting Wick in the head for some reason - where he's become a mix of The Punisher (shoots lots & lots of people, revenge in key driver), Wolverine (doesn't seem to ever die, can use a sword) & James Bond (the suit, good at all forms of combat).

While long, the pacing is good, with enough breathers to keep it interesting. The whole assassin underworld thing is tenuous at best, but doesn't weigh it down too much. There's plenty of visually stunning shots and great use of colour, a good score and some exceptional fight scenes, including a long aerial shot in an abandoned building. There's plenty of great moments where you either chuckle, groan or cheer.",8
FinalSmash1689,"My ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" SPOILER Review:

CONS:

-It had to end.

This is the Apex Mountain of Modern Day Action Movies. These films have been an unexpected surprise and the people behind it have gone above and beyond, perfecting their craft along the way, to entertain the audience! In a world dominated by CGI Blockbusters, the John Wick films have been a breath of fresh air, relying on beautifully crafted stunt choreography, fantastic direction, and actors that came to play and who knew exactly what kind of films they were making. Chapter 4 took everything from the first 3 films and amplified it. I don't wanna spoiler anything here, as this deserves to be experienced first hand. Keanu Reeves was born to play this character and this is his best outing as the character yet! I can't say enough positive things about this film. Pure Action Escapism. 9/10.",9
ajuskoto,"I still remember exactly the atmosphere in the cinema lobby when I wanted to go to the cinema in 2014. At that time, I had no plans at all what film to watch, so I finally decided to watch John Wick after seeing Keanu starring in him, I'm a huge fan of the Matrix. Also, I don't know what the film is about, what genre it is.

After dozens of minutes of watching, I was dumbfounded. John Wick's character is very unique as an assassin -melancholy, his heart is soft so he can cry sadly, his nature is serious and quiet but sadistic and cold-blooded - and his gun-fu action is very cool. Of the hundreds of films I've watched since I was a child, none of the martial arts action films are as good as this one.

A month ago, I purposely re-watched JW123 before watching JW4 last night which I've been waiting for since last year, to refresh my memory so it's more connected with the storyline. The result? Very satisfactory. JW4 is better than all three. Better in terms of selecting new supporting actors, cinematography, storyline, action choreography and in terms of Keanu's acting.

1. Brilliant selection of new characters.

Of the several new supporting actors, Donnie Yen brilliantly managed to play a very significant role in building the story of JW4. His acting is flexible, his appearance is cool, his action is cool, and his refreshing sense of humor helps reduce tension while watching this film, which is about 80% filled with gun-fu scenes. Previously I was a little disappointed with the selection of Mark Dacascos in JW3.

2. Beautiful cinematography.

If you pay close attention, there are a number of things related to cinematography that are relatively different from the previous three series. Starting from the sound system, lighting techniques, color themes and shooting angles. There are a number of scenes that remind me of the Matrix trilogy, including fights under a fountain that looks like rain and a scene at a train station. And the most special, the angle of shooting a la bird view in a fight scene.

3. The storyline is more natural with a perfect ending.

The outline of the story is about John Wick's efforts to free himself from the pressure of The High Table caused by his own actions, breaking the rules by killing Santino D'Antonio in The Continental of New York hotel. At first he had thought of killing all members of The High Table, but his close friends opposed the idea. The ending of the story is perfect, but it's better if I don't tell.

4. Better duration, level and beauty of gun-fu action.

The duration of the film is almost three hours. In some scenes, I almost felt bored, but the director cleverly stopped it and moved on to another scene at the right time. The fight choreography feels more beautiful and seems natural.

5. Acting Keanu Reeves.

In several scenes, John Wick's expressions and body gestures are clearly seen to be exhausted, moreover his opponents are really tougher. On his face were lines that showed he was on the verge of despair. This acting is the main part that makes the ending of the story perfect.

After watching JW4, regardless of whether there was an intentional element of the story writer and director, it's as if JW123 was deliberately made only to form the perfection of the JW4 film. So, it is only fitting that JW4 will be flooded with praise from film critics such as IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. Most likely this film will become the Top Box Office.",9
thehumanx,"Loved the movie and most of the people in the theater loved it too. We clapped and cheered! Oh man, it was such an experience!

For me, its the best in the franchise and the one of the best action movies out there! Almost 3-hour long stay passed in a blink of an eye. Sadly, I missed the post-credit scene, saw it on the YouTube.

This movie has raised the standard of action movies and set itself as a new subgenre.

Also, I just found my new hobby: reading 1-star/negative reviews and their reviews of other movies. They give a new perspective and its fun seeing how they have rated other movies, compare it to yours own. Hahah.",10
Abd_Elrahman_Tarek,"What can I say! This is the best action movie I have ever seen. The action scenes here are designed very carefully and with very high quality. The selection of the cast is wonderful.. All the actors played their role in the best way, especially Donnie Yen, who I consider to be the most important addition to this movie, as he added a lot of quality and beauty to the Action scenes. Also, one of the most important strengths of this movie is the soundtrack, it is legendary and adds a lot to the watching experience. It is the best movie in the John Wick series, and it will remain in the memory for a long time due to the large number of unforgettable scenes. Special thanks to the director and all the staff for their great efforts in making the film come out in such a wonderful way. Finally, this movie must be watched in the cinema to have the best watching experience, so if you have not seen it yet, go to the nearest cinema and watch it on the largest screen, and do not miss this opportunity.",9
zeki-4,"But I prefer Jackie Chan. He can move and does his own stunts.

I guess it looks cool when a slow moving, slowly speaking Keanu Reeves elminates 40+ bad guys in close combat in 5 minutes... but really? A blind guy doing the same?

John Wick 4 should be labelled ""superhero movie"" because this is insane. Not even Rambo in 'Rambo II' or Schwarzenegger in 'Commando' have a killcount this high.

Likewise, the rating for 'John Wick 4' is much too high. The script could be lifted from any B-movie actioner and the action quickly gets repetitive and doesn't know when to move on.

I guess the high rating must because it just looks ""cool"" or whatever.",6
fraser-simons,"This time around the spectacle of death has very high production values in every respect, and once again, they manage to go above and beyond the previous with the set pieces and wild action. It's very long, but every time it started to feel that way, another would emerge that made me forget about the runtime.

However. Where the first two really excelled was in building out the world. The first one was mythological in nature and sets it a bar above and apart, and the next used that to create an interesting underworld. As they've gone on, that aspect has gone away, but by bit. We are firmly in pretty mindless action that stands apart in the way things are shot and the other production aspects. That's all fine, but it does feel slightly sad to leave the most interesting cerebral aspects of the films too, I think. Even if the action movie has evolved into these, which excel above and beyond.",8
jackreinbott,"When I heard the buzz around this movie, I dragged myself to the tv to watch the first three wick movies just so I could fully appreciate the fourth on the biggest screen possible. After the first one, I was absolutely convinced that I was in for something special, and king Keanu did not dissapoint.

John wick 4 is loaded with some of the greatest action scenes out to camera, some of the coolest set pieces ever created, and has an emotional depth to it that we'll and truly took me by surprise...

All I can say now is that I really hope they just leave this franchise alone at this point. I'm down to see spin-offs and prequels, but I genuinely hope they leave the central story untouched, because this movie was the perfect ending to one of the greatest action franchises of all time. Rarely do you find a film series with not a single week link in its library, but John wick has somehow managed to do that, and I really hope it stays that way...

Big two thumbs up!!!",9
jameswprice-43714,"John Wick Chapter 4 is easily the greatest action movie ever made and for me, one of the best movies ever made. Not only does it have varied, high octane, insanely choreographed and nail biting action. It has side characters with emotional beats, that despite its extremely fast pace doesn't sacrifice it's heart.

The film is a non stop thrill ride, with one of the best finales ever. It was so intense in the final act I felt like I couldn't breathe at times. The writing at the end in particular was great and didn't 'betray' the rules of the universe or the table.

Overall, just do yourself a favour and see John Wick 4. You will not regret it.",10
jonesjackson-23987,"Not only was this easily the best John Wick Movie... but this is 100% got to be the top action movie created. May seem far fetched, until you sit in the theater and watch this unbelievable movie. There is simply not a movie that can compare to the action displayed in this film. Unbelievable choreography and stunts, plus an amazing hit man storyline.

This movie shows the true capabilities that John Wick has... and also introduces some awesome new characters, and every character is perfect fitted for this movie. I don't see one thing in this movie that was bad and I highly recommend it to any viewer that has the chance to watch!!",10
themonkey-4,"Yea it's good, but sadly, it's only good.

The charm of the gunfights and the world building take a back seat to endless action. While the action scenes are all okay only the final one brings a little creativity back and all the others should have been replaced by world building.

I'm more interested in the world and characters than the endless gung-fu fights. That being said the characters are rather flat in this installment and the movie focuses more on cool/striking visuals than actually building any depth to the characters. The strength of the Wick movies was always that they showed this world of assassins living in parallel to the normal world, like a good vampire movie, but this movie brings nothing to that lore.",7
viktor-amper,"John Wick, its a movie with more plot holes than bullet holes!

Alot of the stuff happening in this movie makes no sense. The action scenes are to long, not well coordinated and the beauty from the first movie is gone.

Alot of the characters are meaningless and only makes the movie drag out for too long. They also have the power of teleportation.

The plot of this movie goes nowhere and means nothing. The ending is terrible and is a far-grab of ending the story.

One scen in this movie is good, the scene with the fat dude. That scen was ok.

Skip this movie, go watch John Wick (chapter 1) again.",1
D4V1D2411,"I was starting to get a bit tired from this franchise, despite me loving the third movie, on some rewatches, it felt like the only thing happening were action sequences, and they were still very impressive and memorable, its just that 2 and a half hours of that gets tiring at some point and I was a little afraid the same thing was going to happen here and on some degree it does, the action sequences are still very impressive and epic. But sometimes they last a little more than what they should, but this movie has much more story than its predecessors, now John Wick has more of an objective than just kill whoever tries to kill him, here, he really has a chance to be free again and with the help of other characters who also have better motivations in this one, he plans on getting it. Obviously the best thing of this movie are the fighting scenes, combined with their awesome cinematography, music and choreographys it makes for a great experience. I already talked about some some of them lasting a bit too much but that doesnt affect the film as much as it could have. And in this one, we have a more clear villain, who you hate from the first scene from which he appears, he is bad. Elegant and menacing, he is awesome. The side characters and new ones introduced are also very interesting and entertaining to watch, mainly Cain, who I hope gets a spin off or something. And all the movie is like this, the best quality of action a movie can have but stopping at the right times so it doesnt get tiring enough. And finally I want to say that the finale was the best it could have been for this saga, the tension depsite not being a fight is the greatest Ive ever felt watching these movies, you are genuinly terrified from whats about to happen, and you dont want to watch the outcome but you have to because its where everything gets defined. It is definitely, the WORTHY ENDING John Wick deserved.",8
virindra,"I like the John Wick movies, Keanu Reeves is a love able man to watch as an actor. The Wick movies are action packed and well maintained at that point.

The thing I don't understand is that he is a Baba Yaga, the boogyman, but still he is not hard to find by killers. He kinda is a step backwards compared to the men who want to kill him. There is no boogyman anymore. He is shooting at men, they are shooting back, but nobody shoots him in the head.

The scene in the building from above was amazing. It looked like a John Wick's version of a Franklin mint clue game.

John get fired at, besten, thrown out of a building. But because of the kevlar suit he is like a duracel bunny; he just goes on and on. Yes it is fun to watch, but not very believeable. Storywise and for the action; fun to watch.",9
TreeFiddy53,"Okay this movie is INSANE. Insane cinematography. Insane lighting. Insane sound-design. And most of all, insane action -the good ol' gun fights, hand-to-hand combats, sword-fights, everything short of tanks and fighter planes. This is everything the previous movies were, but the duration is 2x. That said, you'll still have to give it all the cinematic liberties to enjoy it thoroughly.

Keanu Reeves did exactly what you've seen him do before, nothing new, but twice as much. Special mention to Donnie Yen for the role that he was given. Rina Sawayama, Hiroyuki Sanada, Bill Skarsg√•rd, Scott Adkins, were GOOD additions.

There may come a point where, if you're not a John Wick fan but a regular film lover, you MAY feel ""Okay, dude. Stop fighting and move on to the next thing."" But if you're a fan and enjoyed the previous ones, you'll have a ball with this movie.",8
josevaep,"John Wick 4 exceeds all expectations, delivering an exhilarating mix of jaw-dropping choreography, thrilling gunfights and captivating swordplay. The anticipation leading up to this film is met with sheer satisfaction, as it combines these elements flawlessly into a stunning cinematic experience. While there are occasional instances of stilted acting, they are easily overshadowed by the spectacle of jaw-dropping action sequences. Without an ounce of regret, I can confidently say that watching John Wick 4 is an absolute pleasure. I'm even looking forward to reliving its brilliance through this stream I've been waiting four more days for. This film undeniably stands as a true masterpiece in the entire series, leaving an indelible mark on the action genre.",10
afatedcircle,"We get much of the same intense action in this installment of the John Wick franchise as we did from the first 3 movies. Near 3 hours of nonstop stunts and gunplay that will have you groaning in pain with the characters, laughing at some and on the edge of your seat at other times. However, one of the noticeable issues this time around is bad cgi at several points of the movie. This is especially noticeable in car chase scenes or when the assassins on John's trail are being hit by vehicles.

The music was as fast paced as the action, no complaints there.

However, can we all just agree that a fight in a club with multiple people dying isn't going to have people continue to dance around you?",8
mrdominoah,"Total score compiled by: N: 10/10 M: 9.5/10 I: 9/10 F: 7.5/10

Reasoning (N); Absolute perfect way to not only do an action movie but also end the mainline run of a franchise with dignity. All of the original characters have a satisfactory conclusion to their character arcs and even newer characters make you instantly make you wish for a standalone movie to know more about their own story. I feel for all the people waiting for a slow moment in the movie so that they can go to the toilet because those scenes are basically non-existent. The scene elevating this movie from a 9 to 10 for me personally is in Paris when everything suddenly transitions into a top-down view (reminiscent of games like hotline miami). The scene then transitions back into the normal third person view and back again into the top-down perspective. All of this looking like a seamless one-shot. Sure, there were some noticeable green-screen shots towards the end but that didn't make the action shots before any less cool.",9
isabelletieu,"Having not watched any of the previous movies, I had no idea what to expect. Seems like these movies are just an excuse to give the audience a festival of gun fights, more absurd as things go on. With the light spider web of a story in the background involving secret organisations and schemes, I felt it was very badly executed, even more since I am French and the pseudo current ruler of this underworld is a French man but his fake antics and accents just failed to cut it. Is this movie supposed to be taken at least a little seriously or just completely for jokes ? I had no idea and that is exactly why I did not like it.",2
danielgroza,"The reason why, for me, the John Wick series stand out from your run-of-the-mill action movies is because of the way in which director and ex-stunt man Chad Stahelski puts the titular hero through the wringer. John Wick--played once again by the reclusive Keanu Reeves--is battered, punched, kicked, stabbed and shot to the brink of unbearable exhaustion. At one point in the movie, he can't even stand up. But he does, fighting through the pain--and that makes him more impressive and inspiring than a guy single-handedly eliminating an army of thugs and coming out squeaky clean on the other side.

""Chapter 4"" continues where the previous one left off. But while ""Parabellum"" jumped right into its action-driven rhythm, here the movie likes to take its time settling in through provocative and luxurious imagery showcasing the opulence and grandeur of its criminal underworld whose leaders--known as The High Table--exercise their power without mercy. While the movie's self-centered presentation serves to impose its authority on the viewer and to make them aware just how deeply-rooted, ancient and powerful the men coming after Wick are, they also linger for a bit too long, stretching towards a sense of narcissism and slowing the movie down too much.

But this is not what I am going to focus on when I talk about ""John Wick: Chapter 4"", nor anyone should.

Instead, let's talk about the bravura choreography of the action scenes, arguably the greatest ever put to film. This franchise had three previous movies before this one, and each one pushed the boundaries more and more, perfecting the craft of the stuntman who is often overlooked. Here, this craft is elevated to an art form through elaborate camerawork and physical skill whose pace is rival to a dancing act. The action scenes are long, brutal, twisted, clever, complex, using the environment they are in to angular precision. After one such scene finishes, we feel both tired and satisfied, sharing Wick's moments of rest and relief. Some people complained that the action scenes are too long, but when executed like this, that's like complaining that a comedy is too funny.

But while action is the foundation on which John Wick is built, don't think for a second that the quiet moments in-between are just filler. Stahelski and his writers Shay Hatten, Michael Finch and Derek Kolstad know that a movie is more than a pretty face. Sure, Wick is a man of few words, Reeves playing him with a grounded sense of modesty; but when he talks, people listen. In one particular scene, both him and his rival Caine (Donnie Yen)--an assassin forced by the High Table to kill Wick and an old friend of his--sit down in a church and contemplate on the existence of God. The movie would have worked without this scene as well, and the discussion is not more philosophical than it has to be, but in between such heavy mounds of action, it offers a sense of peace and serenity that hits just right. And so does John Wick.",8
tiggerden,"First off, I thought the movie was like .... right? So when I was like watching it I was like ... and then it hit me .. right? How can a person not watch this film and feel ... Like ... Right? Totally.

barnabaponchielli,"This fourth chapter adds almost nothing to the John Wick franchise, born somewhat by chance and became a cult narrative for action movie nerds without thickness. The patina and the screenplay are always those of a very high-budget b-movie, full of nonsense and absurdity without explanation: at a certain point one would hope for a narrative turn that goes a bit deeper to explain why the good Keanu Reeves still takes more beatings than usual without ever dying. But nothing, not even that suggestion that had made us think of a parallelism between the Matrix and John Wick is addressed. Too bad, because the idea that Wick was a sort of spin off from the sci-fi dystopia created by the Wachowski sisters could have been suggestive, but I think it was a totally random intuition of some dumb spectator like me. In short, this time the 3 hours of duration and meaningless killings weigh even more than usual, because it lacks the magic or mystery of something other than mere entertainment for decerebrated Russian oligarchs or similar, which John Wick has always been since it's first chapter, after all...",5
rdietman,"I thought JW 1 and 3 were great. 2 was just OK. It seemed like it tried WAY too hard with some of the fight scenes. Same with 4. It just went on and on and on and on and on.

This movie could've, and should've, been an hour shorter. The villains make Stormtroopers look like Olympic marksmen. JW had thousands and thousands of bullets shot at him and not one found his head, yet he shot hundreds of people at long range with a silencer equipped hand gun.

The fight scenes were overly choreographed, slow and labored. And don't get me started on the Blind super assassin.

On the bright side Ian McShane and Skarsgard were great.",5
micahmcnaire,"This movie is exactly what Stahelski had in mind and dreamt of when developing John Wick. This movie is an absolute loveletter to this whole franchise. It looked back at JW 1-3 and what made this franchise great, took the absolute best and made it even better.

The stunt choreography and coordination was always a highlight in John Wick movies, but this movie was able to build an astonishing almost frightening good momentum. ""Momentum"" not only for the stuns themselves but also for the viewers. Momentum and flow is what made this movie truly great.

The cinematography was my personal highlight. Not only was is it able to pick up and greatly reinforce the momentum of the stunt choreography, you could clearly see that every shot and every scene had its own personality and felt unique. With sometimes completely bold and unusual but extremely refreshing perspectives and memorable scenes you would not have expected or even thought of. You could describe whole scenes not by their stunt choreography but by the genius camera angles, cuts, snaps and so on.

This movie sets a really high bar not only for the franchise itself but for all other movies coming this year. By far the best movie in this franchise. Anyone who remotely enjoys and loves to watch JW should watch this movie, without any questions whatsoever.

Close to perfection: 9/10 (since 10/10 is never reachable)",9
LegendaryNugget,"This is the worst John Wick movie out of the 4. This movie is basically just the Long chicken fight scenes from Family Guy. He gets hit by 4 cars full speed, all 1000 enemies have worse aim than stormtroopers they are basically in a single file line waiting their turn to attack him instead of all at once he never reloads his guns when he should clearly be out of ammo several times. I leaned over to my dad in one scene and said let me guess when him and that guy with the dog meet to where they can both shoot each other both of their guns are going to click and not shoot and then they are going to get into a fist fight 30 seconds later exactly what I said happened the whole movie is the most generic thing I've ever seen. The only good things I can say about this movie are the set designs and scenery all of it's beautifully filmed. Oh ""YEAH"" and he also falls from tall buildings several times and doesn't seem phased at all after hitting poles on the way down.",4
parasvanzari,"For starters, you are here because you saw the 3 parts and now want to know if 4th was worth making. And I here, guarantee it was worth every paise/penny.

This is not just a killing machine movie like 3 others, this one promises some emotions, which is, on repeated basis, broken with a action sequence.

Donnie Yen, as it goes, gives everything behind his kicks, but I wish he did that in this. He was outstanding but, the way I love to see him was missing, yeah well that's my problem.

Action sequences, the stairs one in the end, was so perfectly filmed, I was wanting that sequence to not end at all. Marvelous.

The weary but focused John Wick is ready to 'Kill'em all' and he almost did. But, I won't say much, go watch this.",9
andrew-hill515,"It's better than the last 2 sequels, which felt like diminishing returns, and was pretty fun overall.

I'm probably not going to watch it a second time, as only the first one is re-watchable so far, but it was a relatively fun one-time watch.

It didn't set my world on fire, and was basically the same film again, done in the same way by the same people, and so feels pretty samey.

Which was to be expected as it's the fourth time they made the same film with weaker and weaker purpose, drive and motivation.

The first one was revenge-fuelled and fully justified because of the dog and also what it represented.

The second was retrieving a car, which was resolved in the first scene, which he wrecked immediately, but only wanted a photo in the glove box, followed by owing some nobody a favour, doesn't want to, does it anyway, then action movie gunfights and a sequel-bait ending.

The third was... I want to say he wanted to retire again, or wanted some exposition, or wanted another photo of his wife, or something. It doesn't really matter, it was just one long fight scene of a movie, like Shoot Em Up but less fun.

The fourth one was weak again plot-wise, but that's expected by now. And the motivation was unclear again until the third act, and seems to be wanting to quit killing people by making it abundantly clear that he is just trying not to die by making it as likely as possible he'll die and trying to quit killing people by killing a hundred people...

It was fun to watch, but is nothing more than that. An action movie about action movie stuff, with some fig leaf excuse for the action movie to occur.",8
jonnyola-24074,"Please do not make John Wick chapter 5. In the name of god have mercy. Almost no part of the movie is real, if you want to see how people die they should consider documenting reality to create new movies. Rambo sometimes is funny well here not even that. Thank the lord I did not pay to see this fairy tale and watch it for free otherwise I would be looking for refund. Folks, save few notes and avoid this piece of nonsense. Wick is some sort of immortal character who makes others to miss the target from 20cm away, unbelievable, or maybe he has some powers that cause that, I don't get it.

Donnie yen does occupy the smoke screen space with his flawless stunts and swag which is easily matchable or even surpasses wick.... Thanks to stunts team for the brilliant choreography there by set a benchmark for action films... Also chad stahelski does a balancing act of placing stunts at the right time.... There are some lagging moments where Dog comes to the rescue Saksgard villainous act goes in vain for falling out to cheap thrills... A shocker for the wick fans that might deceive you...,7
ferforeman,You just cant get enough of john wicks fighting realism....i just got exhausted just looking at the movie...when he fights in the round about in paris... he used moving cars as weapons...when he fights with nun chucks it wasnt the bruce lee way it was the logical way that he used them....like a baseball bat cut in half with chains..lol....this guy is always thinking and that.is why he survive so many attacks...never afraid to die but doesnt want to until his task is achieved.....REVENGE.......keanu is a new kind of action hero a true mma fighter with the heart of a lion....so all that being said this is why i gave this movie a ten it make the matrix look like a after school special with it came to the fight scenes...to me this is close to real fighting in a movie as its gonna get...and by the way this is the best one hands down.,10
truman-41210,"Remembering John Wick the first movie I was enthralled by the mysterious, feared and shadowy Mr Wick who offered up intrigue and overwhelming focus for revenge. The skills and fortitude presented by the character added the action to an action movie.

The following movies John wick -4 SERIOUSLY lack in any sort of storyline except guns, killing and an unrealistic ability to not get shot dead in a hail of a million bullets fired by 'professional' Sicarios.

The latest instalment was absolutely no different, the storyline is weak and boring, the main character must be a god to not die in the usual hail of bullets AND being run over more than 3 times.

TBH I towards the end in the stairwell scene I was WISHING someone would just kill the John there and then, after all he's just fallen hundreds of stone steps, gets up and starts again... Total Bull.

The usual bull of the good guy being able to kill a hundred hardened criminal well armed fighters just to be thwarted by a single unimpressive and willowy man is rife within the movie industry, Its a shame they also applied such a ridiculous storyline in this movie.

Thankfully then end scene was a total surprise, that part alone was worth the price of the popcorn, but not the hotdog!

THANKFULLY his character is dead.. Or is he?",5
maindraaritomo,"What I like about this franchise ever since is fighting to kill then weapons are used including firearms. Bullets shot in short range is one crazy thing from over million others. Also how action is started very soon when the movie is on. People killing each other, rumble, brawl, combat in the middle of civilization. But, I wish, director speeds up the fight just a lil bit. I almost sense of Keanu moves the way Liam Neeson did in Taken. Indeed Keanu, Hiroyuki and Donnie are not young anymore. I believe the thrill would move audience more if kicks and punches thrown faster.

Am a big fan of Scott Adkins and so remarkable he is a chubby evil villain here. Good choice. Bet audience who doesn't know him would be wowed, the big butt antagonist does spin kick.

I also find few trade marks of past movies from actors brought back, Donnie for swinging fist.

Last but not least, such films are getting away from reality, too bad, bullet proof suits, rolling falling down on 200 steps without injuries, well, better if such scenario is re-looked if the franchise goes on.

Thank you.",7
kospeti,"The story had some nice setups and payoffs, I enjoyed the story and the ending.

However I didn't like the action. On multiple occasions it was a parody of itself, instead of being cool it was just funny. That could work in a more lighthearted movie, but in this one, it felt off.

The suits got even more ridiculous, they're mega OP against firearms or vehicles, but suck against swords and arrows.

The VFX was all over the place, often I was hearing gunshots, but there was nothing happening on screen.

For some reason a blind man can beat an unlimited amount of armed soldiers, in the beginning they tried to setup some tricks for how he could do that, but that was abandoned after the first use.

There are characters that are set up to be very important, only to leave the story and never appear again, even when someone closed to them is mentioned, they are forgotten.

The black supporting character was cool, underutilized in my opinion.",7
cahidi,"As everybody knows by know, or rather, as everybody who knows who John Wick is, you can expect so much action, gun fight, knife fight and blood shed. The story of Baba Yaga continues in this fourth chapter. I do like this one better than the previous chapter. Though I also find it a little ridiculous when he kept rolling down the stairs like a ball after getting kicked. I was thinking, ""Seriously? What are you? A ball?! Stop rolling down the stairs!"" And I also find it really weird that those people at the club kept on dancing although they're watching a fight unfolding right before their very eyes. That's odd, at least for me.",7
jessemichaelrussell,"The scenes and sequences of this movie were good. The visuals and action were top tier. However, this movie is like eating a slice of delicious pie. It's really good. Then you get force fed the rest of the pie. This would have been two great movies, instead it is one bad movie. Again, it's great, but at some point I felt like I was being water boarded. The sound could use some work. Also, the movie ended up feeling like one 3 hour long meme. Cliches and call backs, references and bad jokes. The action was premium judo gun fu. I just wanted it to be over for way too long. Don't let choreographers direct the movie next time. If you want to watch it, do it in chunks.",5
kawtharffathalla,"(Directing / Story) John Wick 4 might be the best action-packed experience of the year so far! I think this chapter outdone the franchise with its ultimate action ride, and a runtime of almost 3 hours the adrenaline barely drops through the sequences and the thrill leaves you on the edge of your seat.

The director Chad Stahelski successfully combined an artistic and stylish feel of action with actual tension-based buildup on a big scope pushing beyond limits and presenting a fully engaging experience.

When it comes to the plot, the sequel follows the same story structure from the previous parts and keeps building on that simple construct by adding new elements to connect us further with the universe which is something I appreciate, I really liked how it still managed to introduce the new characters with a sense of depth to give the story extended development and move the narrative forward, and still show us more of John Wick and his changing inner motifs.

Although I enjoyed every second of it, I would've preferred cutting down the runtime a bit, some scenes could've been shorter.

(Performances) The stunt work and action choreography were impeccable and fascinating!! Blasting with violence that is smoothly executed, especially by the third act it gets 10 times better (The ""Arc de Triomphe"" scene was insane!!)

Keanu Reeve continues to deliver the best action performance ever, his performance in all these fight sequences is just impressive.

The whole cast had their moment to shine and brought so much to their characters and delivered dynamic performances.

(Cinematography) The camera work in Chapter 4 is beyond and above with astonishingly bold stylish visuals.

The cinematographer Dan Laustsen played masterly with the neo-noir visuals reflecting rich ambiance through all the different settings and locations of the movie with high attention to details in each environment as well as the symbolisms behind it.

The colors were always blasting with vivid lighting choices creating a beautiful contrast.

The camera language was explorative, and Highly immersive as it puts you right in the action when needed and into the character's space for closeness, it played amazingly with various angles and movement styles.",8
emilwindward,"This action movie is great, it's a way greater than all the previous plotless Wick's movies, it surely stands alone in the series. But, there is one huge BUT, there is a black spot in the middle of each frame, a black hole which intensely sucks and this hole is the John Wick and the hundred years old hairy wooden hippy playing John Wick - poor Mr. Reeves. Everything is totally WEAK about this character from his name to the person playing it. Firstly, Baba (Yaga) in Russian is a degrading word for ""woman"" equivalent to the words like wench, slut, broad, dame or hag if the woman is old and vicious which is the case of our Johny what makes him in plain English ""Hag Yaga"" - how stupid is that? Baba Yaga is a vicious old witch hag from Russian kids' folklore stories. It doesn't sound cool in relation to a coldblooded killerman, it sounds like Bubba Gump shrimp. It would be much coole to call him Kashchey the Deathless which is Voldemort/Sauron character from Russian folklore. And what is a Belorussian gypsy I'd like to ask the creators of this movie? There is no Romas or Gypsies in Belorussia only Hag Yaga - Lukashenko! Gypsies live in Moldova, West Ukraine, Romania, Hungary. The authors clearly don't know and don't care a damn what they are making the movie about! Ok, we can leave that alone. The worst part about this film isn't etymology anyway, but is that I laughed at every Mr. Weak's fight scene as bad as if I was watching Mr. Bean, and, believe me, that's not a good sign for an action packed dramatic serious shoot-em-up Kill-Bill movie. For the part of Wick with the same success they could have cast Adrian Brody straight from Polanski's Pianist. Old, stooping, bow-legged, hippy-looking, bearded and hairy Keanu Reeves is the worst cast an action film has ever known in the history of the world cinema! He should have played parts of scientists and musicians not roles of Steven Seagal. Every fight scene with Weak John looks crying-out fake. He doesn't mean it, he doesn't mean a single blow, he doesn't even try - he is OLD, he can't do martial arts and acrobatics and it's a torture to watch him trying. He doesn't produce an impression of lethal killer, he produces impression of a laughing stock, of a scarecrow on a stick. When I think how much time it is going to take the characters of Steven Seagal, Van Damme, Arny, Stallone, Jet Li, Jacky Chan or Black Mamba from Kill Bill to annihilate John to nanoparticles, my answer is from one to five seconds. You know how long would last a fight scene between Great John Weak and cleric John Preston from Equilibrium (2002)? - about one sec - and there would be three Johns Wicks. Even Charles' Angeles would beat all the dust out of poor Johny in ten seconds. The only main character from old action movies whom Weak John would confront without being killed instantly is John McLane. It would take about five minutes of some heavy fighting and a lucky chance for McLane to finish off the Weak one. All in all Keanu Reeves completely lacks what it takes to produce on screen the effect of a deadly threat, he only makes one laugh and pity him. It is clearly visible that when he throws some big bloke, it's not he who do the action, it's the stuntmen who jumps and sends himself flying, Keanu Reeves has little strength only to move his own hands and carcass through the air. Keira Knightley was wielding nunchucks better in Domino than this poor old superhero. And as an actor - he is not an actor, he is a log trying to look serious and menacing. In spite of all this said it's still a surprisingly good action movie from the old times mostly due to the good job of the rest of the crew.",2
mendymariamKE,"Initially, I was concerned that the third installment of the John Wick franchise lacked the same level of excitement and energy as its predecessors. However, I am delighted to say that my worries were unfounded as John Wick 4 manages to surpass the previous films with its action-packed sequences.

Despite its lengthy runtime, the movie keeps you engaged right from the start when the action kicks off in Osaka, Japan.

The technical aspects of the film such as sound engineering, editing, direction, and cinematography are top-notch, as expected. (As I hoped)

The John Wick movies stand out from other American action films that heavily rely on CGI and poorly written scripts.

The John Wick franchise is a breath of fresh air with its fast-paced storyline, mesmerizing stunts, and remarkable choreography that leaves you in awe. The fight scenes featuring Reeves and Yen are breathtakingly authentic and captivating, unlike the unrealistic superhero movies.

In summary, John Wick 4 is a must-watch for action movie lovers as it delivers an exceptional viewing experience that you won't find elsewhere.",9
ernesteva,Said only in death he would have peace and to be free again. No ties to the table at all anymore. So is he really dead or retired again. Baja yaga sent chills doen their backs and he taking out more then the table probably could imagine. What will make Mr. Wick return from the shadows and will he have his car? Winston knew what Johnathon had planned which is to be free once more to never be bothered again. To morn his wife which he really never had a chance to at all. Hopefully there's another twist which only two different reasons can make him come out the shadows and that's the daughters of his friends.,10
Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,"Welcome back, Streamers! As has been highly-anticipated, our favorite dog-loving, retired hitman is back in action this weekend. Yes, John Wick resumes his quest to be free from the tyranny of the High Table and all of its bureaucratic, bloody nonsense while continuing to grieve the deaths of his beloved wife and his adorable pup from Chapter 1. These John Wick movies usually have great fight sequences, good visuals and pulsing soundtracks - that's why we keep coming back, so let's see whether Chapter 4 delivers.

Do I really need to explain the plot of John Wick: Chapter 4? It is very much a continuation of what has come before. Keanu Reeves returns as assassin-extraordinaire, John Wick. Wick runs afoul to the High Table once again, which puts him back on their radar. The High Table holds Winston (Ian McShane) accountable for John Wick's actions and puts another bounty on Wick's head. John Wick goes from location to location and from elaborate action sequence to even more elaborate action sequence for more than 2 and a half hours to avoid death and gain freedom. Gun-toting hijinks ensue.

First, John Wick: Chapter 4 is too long. There is no reason for this movie to be almost 3 hours long. The plot is not that intricate. In fact, it is basically the same as all of the other movies, except the first one, which was really driven by the grief and revenge of the John Wick. Two hours definitely would have gotten the job done. Even though the action sequences are entertaining, they can get overlong and become very exhausting. I can't imagine being Keanu running from place to place, fighting, shooting and falling all over the place. Bless his heart. No wonder he sounds so out of breath.

What you really came to John Wick: Chapter 4 for is what it delivers in spades: exquisitely elaborate action set pieces. The movie takes place all over the world, and each location looks beautiful and interesting. There is such ornate and complicated set design, and you know it's especially fragile so it can get destroyed with all of the shooting and fighting. And, these sets do, indeed, get destroyed. There a multiple shoot outs that take 20 minutes, or more, each. It can get fatiguing because once you've seen one shoot out then you've seen them all, but John Wick: Chapter 4 shows that not all elaborate shoot outs are alike. Thankfully, this movie has a good sense of humor as well.

Ultimately, John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers the action, dry humor, beautiful shots and elaborate set pieces that we have come to expect from this franchise. Keanu Reeves shows up and puts himself through it. While the story is basically the same as all of the other John Wick movies, it is still as entertaining as ever with clever stunts and even some good musical moments. I'd say it's totally worth a trip to theater with a big box of popcorn.",8
cyberjew-58878,"Look I love action movies... I even loved the prior John Wick films, although #3 was a bit over the top gory.

But this one just goes overboard with the unbelievability factor.

When John starts getting smashed HARD into cars and just gets back up... When John falls out of a very high window and lands on a van super hard and then slams onto the ground and just gets back up... When John rolls down 122 concrete steps and you actually HEAR bones break near the end, but he gets back up showing no real ill effects... But my favorite is John driving a classic muscle car, and driving it right into someone and then slamming that person into another vehicle... then when he backs up the car has no damage at all to its front end?

And then the same car gets crashed into by another car at full speed spinning it around and when he starts driving it again it has no damage at the crash site?

I mean just say you're making a live action Grand Theft Auto 5 where the character and the vehicles can't take damage and I guess then it's maybe OK???

Oh and make sure that tons of people are around when guns are going off like crazy and people are getting stabbed with axes but make sure they act like they don't even notice or care... or even get scared a tiny bit for their own lives with bullets flying all around... Oh and also be sure there are no such thing as police anywhere in existence at any time.

I could go on, but it's not worth it.

Basically, if you enjoy watching other people play video games then you'll like this.

Donnie Yen is fun to watch as always, but then one of my other favorites in the martial arts world is Scott Adkins... and when the movie ended I said where were his scenes?? He was supposed to be in this. Then I look it up and he was the big fat guy??? Seriously!! What a horrible missed opportunity for an amazing fighter to show his talents alongside Donnie Yen!

But I guess when Keanu is old and slow they didn't want Scott to show him up too badly... also must be why they made Donnie blind.

Anyway. Worth a watch but just dismiss all reality and imagine you're watching a lifelike video game instead.

5 out of 10...",5
inforlonghaul,"I've enjoyed all of the John Wick movies, especially the first one. After seeing the reviews calling this one of the best action movies and maybe even the best John Wick movie, I went into the theater yesterday looking to be blown away. And the theater was packed.

Unfortunately, I tried to like this one, but I just can't. I enjoy action movies just as much as many of us but John Wick 4 went to the extreme and made it long, boring, and flatly unenjoyable.

John Wick 4 has a nearly three hour runtime, but two hours of it is nothing but him fighting and shooting people and there's about 30 minutes of actual dialogue progressing the storyline and about 15 minutes of filler/B roll shots.

A total two hour run time with the action scenes cut in half would have made for a far more enjoyable movie. The old saying ""too much of a good thing is a bad thing"" holds true for this movie.

I rewatched the first John Wick when I got home from the theater yesterday and it clearly showed to me how much John Wick 4 had strayed from the first one.

Many of you may enjoy John Wick 4, but unfortunately experience was not.",4
choi-38574,"I was able to focus on John Wick itself thanks to the ridiculous but easily convincing worldview of John Wick's movie. In particular, the action that is tightly packed without a break even during the long running time makes me hold my breath and makes me unable to let go of the tension. Rather than creating a resistance to this push-up action, John Wick's desperate appearance of life approached us, third observers, recreationally through action, and eventually made us burst into a cheerful laugh like a tracker.

It is a film that focuses on the fun of the action genre and captures it lightly and neatly.",8
elvisvkolaj,"Movie was amazing, a lot of action great scenes and cinematics but it is an action movie right?

Have I lost the plot somewhere or am I not getting something about movies anymore?

In which part of the word , Paris????, you can have a single gunshot or a punch and not be crowded by police immediately???

I mean I have been loyal to John Wick but it turns me off a little bit the fact that it's loosing A LOT the touch to reality. Hour long gunfight in Paris, an actual European city, without a single sirene, people murdered with axes in clubs and people keep dancing while looking at it, until the scene finishes and then they go running outside. Many mistakes and telegraphy in the choreography of the fight scenes.

I would describe it exactly as I would describe fast and furious cause they have EXACTLY the same touch to reality. I get it, it's a neo-noir , it needs this exaggeration but I can't stand it scene after scene.",6
ritesh657,"John Wick 4 is a relentless and unswerving action masterclass which pushes the envelope of this genre to its peak potential. Chad Stahelski's direction is exemplary. The cinematography is splendid, colour grading is remarkable and the action set pieces are dazzling and devastating. Keanu Reeves as usual gives marvelous performance in hot pumping blood bath which elevates the standards of real hand-to-hand action choreography and ingenious set pieces. Overall a John Wick is glorious mayhem which is a feast for action lovers.

What's Good?

Remarkable Cinematography and striking colour grading.










Why should you STREAM it?

If you loved watching Wick kick asses in the previous editions then there's no point missing this. A genuine action marvel.",9
valmont1702,"This Chapter 4 of the John Wick saga is a true masterpiece.

There is a lot to say about, but from the richness, depth and variety of the characters, to the obvious search for iconic visuals that imprint your retina to forever leave a mark in your memory... There is this lore and deep mythology, with its codes and numerous complex links... Which all make for an extremely tasty action movie, that offers martial arts and/or action scenes that are equally groundbreaking and unique in the way that it renders and impacts your experience as a movie viewer. There clearly are three-four long sequences that make you feel like you're witnessing something special... It's intense, creative, beautifully shot, nicely paced and of course perfectly staged. The photography is exquisite from beginning to end (it puts you in awe a couple of times)... And the whole piece is magnificently served by a plethoric cast of very very high quality...

It might be pure action, but like the greatest adventure-action movies in history, it has several powerful sceneries/settings/locations that obviously add-up to the fine taste the movie leaves you... Also, the few story bits that punctuate the movie are a delight that thickens the whole experience, leading the way towards some cool twists and outcomes...

Overall, a true masterpiece, for sure.

This Chapter 4 of John Wick very much places itself in the heights of Kill Bill 1&2... And might be remembered as a classic in the history of high quality action cinema.",10
Sting5,"John Wick Chapter 4 (JWCH4) is the greatest action movie with epic sequences. If you'retire of slow-motion films, this is a must-see. You should see this film! It's possibly the greatest action film forever made. Trust me, I've seen enough action movies. It's the best I've ever watched. JWCH4 is a must-see movie for extreme-action fans out there. This cinema features heart-stopping camera work, including fabulous aerial shots (that one with slitted 9MM in Sig-MPX, it was so dope) and uncommon camera angles. And The sets are beautiful too including the mirror gallery to the art museum and the Continental, dope. The lighting and set plans are also top-notch, with club and strobe lights giving a badass atmosphere. The car drift and fight scenes are impeccably choreographed, making for an adrenaline-fueled viewing experience. Don't forget on this extreme action-packed movie. Boundary heat increased in each film - the choreography in this movie is insane. I was so into it that I didn't even blink twice. I'm a huge action film fan ever since Transporter 2, and let me tell you, this movie blew me continuously.",10
keremtex3,"Unnecessarily prolonged scenes end with a fire to the head and classic tai chi exercises performed earlier...Unoriginal villains. Constantly repeated scenes and a sense of belonging that can't get the audience into the story in any way. One of the most mediocre films not only in the series, but also for the action genre.

There's no franchise more scrappy and likable than the John Wick movies of the last decade. The first film, 2014's John Wick, was a low-budget affair, helmed by an unproven director, stuntman Chad Stahelski, and starring a then-unbankable Keanu Reeves. The movie did OK in theaters but found a more appreciative fanbase on home video.",4
stermix501,"Keanu's top movies list just got bigger.

Although I watched all 3 previous of this franchise, I was mostly bored to death by the continuous jiu jitsu fighting, but the great casting and production design always appealed my senses.

The 4th one wouldn't lack in these strengths, but the Indian-movie-like duration was scaring the heck out of me. A few minutes in and I had forgotten my fears. Great scenery, super casting and thrilling action were in the rendez-vous. Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Sanada, Marko Zaror and the unreckognisable -until after the movie- Skott Adkins made my night.

What a great feeling to see my favorite actors, and particularly Keanu and Donnie fight together or against each other. Skott Adkins gave an amazing performance not only in fighting but also in acting this time.

This last movie I got from RARBG lost brothers was a treat. The feared duration is no problem if I want to watch it again, already watched the last 30-40min more than once. So I decided and already collected the whole franchise.

Despite an ending that similarly to Daniel Craig's James Bond closes nicely the franchise, there seem now to exist so many possibilities for broadening the francise to any possible extent.",10
mhmtffgf,"If you enjoy watching over-egged, relentless fight scenes with no real story then this is the film for you and your 2 brain cells. Easy to follow, limited dialogue and the bullets don't seem to kill anyone. Amazing how many times John Wick can fall down 220 plus steps and effortlessly get up and go again. Furthermore, the genius idea of a blind assassin might not be to everyone's taste but it's amazing what you can do these days with a walking stick. Bonus - you can get away with a sleep in the middle and still keep up. The actual storyline (if you can call it that) could have been wrapped up in 5 minutes, but I guess they had a film to make so needed to stretch it out - and boy, did they?!",2
M0n0_bogdan,"Of course I had fun. It's that kind of semi-mindless fun I love!!!

But I would, together with the previous three instalments, to add John Wick to the status of elevated action movies. Why would only horror have this status? Beyond all the references from previous action movies and action movie directors it just look awesome and cool and elegant. Every setting, every set-piece is there to be eye-candy beside the eye-candy action and stunts.

All those stunts...they were all so incredible and beautiful. I mean really beautiful. It made me think of the creativity of these people but also the entire human kind that it is capable to do all these stunts and still function after. All for our entertainment.

Chad, please make more.",9
Phil_M_A_Kerr,"Seeing as Stahelski was a stuntman during the Matrix trilogy, it makes sense that John Wick movies are back-to-back stunts turned up to 11.

Reeves himself was a rough and tumble ice hockey player back in the day in Canaydia. Those roots show throughout.

The images are decadent with colour but not subtle. The story and dialogue is workmanlike and efficient.

The action peaks in an epic sequence that is part Taxi Driver's overhead shot after the massacre, part hi-res FPS video game 3rd person replay, and it touches on genius.

Each of these movies has expanded the ""Wick world"" so to speak, and in doing so Wick hasn't had an opportunity to reflect. It's been run and gun since day one, son.

Should there be another chapter, and I suspect there will be, here's hoping they slowly strip back the layers of decadence and allow us a moment of peace and happiness.

But let us earn that tranquility with one final run. What say you, Mr Wick?",8
creztor-65805,"Don't, just don't. I was eagerly awaiting this release and boy was I surprised and not in a good way. First, it feels long and drawn out. The fight scenes just drag on and feel lifeless. I was almost 2 hours in and thought it would be finishing soon, based on the story and what was happening but boy was I wrong.

Yes, the movie is shot well. It's visually stunning and the fight scenes are generally good. However, and without mentioning any spoilers, the acting isn't great, some characters and their backgrounds are just plain stupid and a few other things are just so detached from reality is beyond a joke.

If you are on the fence, don't watch this. You'll regret it.",3
Pritchie45,"This is the fourth movie in a franchise which has been perfectly concluded and fulfills the intent of an ending, to leave the audience satisfied. My satisfaction isn't only that this long ride has ended on a high note but also elevated all the previous sequels that felt directionless. All the unsatisfying exploration that reduced the enigma of the original movie all comes together with this final piece of the puzzle and paints a beautiful picture that is summed up by John Wick himself, the whole franchise revolves around a loving husband trying to attain peace. In a ride with no time to pause for emotional development this characterisation of Wick by himself is dense enough to add sufficient depth to the character that barely speaks and doesn't emote. It's like a star that expands viciously and the unsustainable chemical reaction causes the star to collapse on itself. This summeration is the collapse that starts the process of transforming this ferosous red giant into a nicely dense white dwarf.

The best aspect of the movie is that it maximises style in order to make up for its little substance. The sharp focus results in memorable villains and henchmen, stunning locations, and consistent pulling with engaging choreography that never feels familiar within a three hour movie or multiple hours of movies in this franchise. Cain being blind was not necessary, Scott Adkins being in a fatsuit was not necessary, Skarsgard's French accent wasn't necessary, but all of these gave style like how a suit styles a gentleman. I loved that you explore John Wicks spiritual side with a light conversation about talking to his deceased wife and meeting his family and friends who have a genuine relationship with Wick unlike his previous companions who seemed more transactional than a feeling of love and loyalty.

The beauty of this movie is primarily based on two aspects, everybody wears a suit and all the locations were traditional churches with mediaeval architecture. The religious imagery such as crosses, clergy and candles adds real world elements that connect with the audience. The action scenes are clean and the top down perspective was executed brilliantly.

The only thing that stops it from being perfect is it's long runtime. The substance of the film doesn't justify the extend length of the movie but the style is gravitating. A slight amount of fat could have been trimmed like John's first adventure in the desert, cutting to the DJ and causing a break in the action frequently and Nobody meeting with the Marquis. The final nitpick is there are an unnecessary amount of tattoos that conflict with the traditional styles in other aspects of the movie. Finally the ending is muddled although satisfying.",9
rectorj-35132,"Not sure where people are getting ""the best Wick/action movie ever"", because that's not the movie I watched. I just watched the first 3 Wick movies before this one, and I'm glad I did. Because the quality between them is glaringly obvious. Any action flick like these you have to suspend your imagination, but between JW1 and JW4, well you might as well remove your brain before stepping in to the theater. I appreciated JW1 because he got hurt and you could see the suffering as the film went on. The shooting and fight scenes were tactical and tight and extremely well coordinated. JW2, little more suspension with the bullet proof suit, ""but it's gonna hurt"". And it did. He got hit by a couple cars, eh ok it's a movie. He got stitched up here and there, etc. But by the time we get to JW4, bullets are now bouncing off the bullet proof suit that everyone is wearing, not using cover and just covering their head with the coat, getting hit by cars at full speed over and over and over and then dropping from 2 stories, crushing the roof of a van and just chugging along. And John Wicks aim has gotten a lot worse. It's too bad. The series started to degrade just a bit with JW3 and this one just went full send.",6
steveinadelaide,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is a movie that adheres to the expectations of those who have seen the franchise's earlier instalments. The film's runtime is nearly three hours, and it does not disappoint when it comes to action. The movie commences with John Wick embarking on a battle against a group of assassins pursuing him. John Wick's combat skills are honed, and he quickly dispatches his opponents. The High Table, a group of powerful individuals, appears, and their leader declares that John must die. Caine, a former colleague of John's, is recruited to assist in John's assassination. John must use all his abilities to stay alive, but the odds are against him.

The action scenes in the film are spectacular, with some of the most excellent stunt work seen in a long time. There is plenty to see for those who appreciate gunplay and hand-to-hand combat. The stunts are impressive, and the choreography is immaculate. The action in this film is so captivating that viewers will be on the edge of their seats for the entire movie. The scenes come thick and fast and are continually building up to a climax that is nothing short of unforgettable. The actors deliver outstanding performances and excel at bringing their characters to life. Although the storyline is satisfactory, the film's final moments are particularly noteworthy.

The movie felt a tad too lengthy and stagnant in certain places. Some of the fight scenes feel repetitive and are repeated several times throughout the movie. Nevertheless, John Wick's fans will undoubtedly appreciate this film. Be sure to see it on the biggest screen available to you!",7
jnkoch-87591,"If you love John Wick, you will love this film. This is a beautiful and appropriate end to the best action movie series of all time. John Wick 4, like 1-3 before it, is pure entertainment.

Everything in this movie not only ""works"", but it wraps up one hell of a four-film ride. From the opening scene to the closing credits, John Wick 4 met and exceeded all my expectations. That was no small task - not because my expectations matter (they don't), but because this movie had to tie up a lengthy, complex, and ever-growing story in a way that honores the quality of the first three films while doing what each John Wick film does best, making a unique story fit perfectly within a broader movie universe.

I can't promise you will love this movie as much as I do, but I can promise, if you are a fan of John Wick, you will absolutely love this film and you won't spend $16 any better way than buying a ticket to see this masterpiece. Go watch it!!",10
bacikadzen,"John Wick 4 is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the saga of the legendary assassin. Keanu Reeves delivers another stellar performance as the unstoppable John Wick, who faces his most formidable foes yet in his quest for vengeance and freedom. The action sequences are breathtaking and inventive, showcasing the skills and charisma of Reeves and his co-stars, especially Donnie Yen as Caine, a blind former colleague of Wick who becomes his ally. The film also expands the mythology of the John Wick universe, introducing new characters and locations that add depth and intrigue to the story. The cinematography, music, and editing are all top-notch, creating a stylish and immersive experience for the viewers. John Wick 4 is a must-see for fans of the franchise and action lovers alike. It is a rare example of a sequel that surpasses its predecessors in every aspect. I give it 5 stars out of 5.",10
chet19,"Keanu is great, and it was cool to see him team up with Winston and Lawrence Fishbourne again. But the casting was real bad with a little guy like the clown from ""It"" being the main bad guy. Was anyone scared of this guy? Do you look at him and be terrified to face him in a gunfight? Nope! Plus...was he really THAT bad? All he was doing was enforcing the rules of the Table and the hitman organization. Winston let Wick escape in the previous film, and had to accept his punishment. Wick had broken the rules too, and the hunt for him was justified. It's not like Pennywise was after Wick and Winston for fun...no, he was just following the rules. Also, for future villains, if you are going to choose someone to fight on your behalf, don't pick a blind man. I give this a 10 for the action and for Winston and Wick's scenes, but it only gets a 6 because the ""bad guy"" wasn't bad at all. So I call it an 8.",8
lazirdamha,"What a great action movie from Hollywood...so far its the best from John Wick franchise...the martial art choreography and the action sequence is breathtaking...the whole movie is well-paced, you don't even feel like it's a 3 hours movie. The villains are interesting too...with distinctive self-talent and strong character...

The ending is quite satisfying except for the fact that John Wick is presumably dead...for me,the story should've ended that way...and stay that way...because any possible sequel attempt (such as JW5) might spoil the franchise's legacy and respect...any effort to bring John Wick back to life will looks kind of 'unreal' and 'cheap' (just for the sake of storyline continuation)...

It's a relief to finally watch this kind of satisfyingly good movie...it's been a long time...its a great action movie BUT i frankly don't agree that some says this movie is the greatest action movie of all time...for me,it is not...they surely haven't watch 'The Raid 2' just yet...now that's the king...",9
dandantimes,"The latest installment of the John Wick franchise is a cinematic masterpiece, with phenomenal cinematography and choreography that will leave you mesmerized from beginning to end. Director Chad Stahelski pulls no punches, delivering a gun-fu epic that is not just a series of combat scenes, but entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography and synchronization required is simply incredible, and the film continues to find new ways to entertain with kills, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, and much more.

What really stands out, however, is the dazzlingly lit environments and the music that kicks as much butt as what you see on screen. Many of the action scenes take place at night, and the lighting is simply stunning, resulting in a visually stunning film that is a feast for the eyes and the ears.

The introduction of new characters in this world, including Donnie Yen and Rina Sawayama, adds to the excitement and makes for an even more enjoyable experience. While Keanu Reeves may be less nimble at his age, he still manages to deliver an impenetrable force that is a force to be reckoned with.

While there may be some plot armor to forgive, the longer takes and overall action sequences make up for it. This is a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish, and you won't even notice the 169-minute runtime. If you're a fan of the franchise, you won't be disappointed. But even if you're not, the phenomenal cinematography alone is worth the price of a ticket.",9
Polotovar,"John Wick did not disappoint with his action again. At least for me. In my opinion, this series is pretty safe. He can do action scenes and that's the main thing for me and I was entertained the whole movie. Add to the fighting and shooting a hilarious soundtrack and the fun was taken care of. I've heard a bit of criticism about the length, but I was fine with it. I wasn't bored for a moment. I also praise the surprise ending. I thought the fourth episode was very good. But after some thought, I'm still leaning towards the third one, which charmed me with its action a bit more than here. The locations were also great and I liked them a lot, but I will mention the third part again, which appealed to me more with its setting. I don't have much to add. John Wick is a luxury action series for me and probably always will be. The action is the main thing here for me and it succeeded this time and once again I praise the surprise ending. For me, a great film that I recommend to fans of the series or action genre enthusiasts.",8
covingka,"I a huge JW fan, and after waiting 4 years for this installment, was expecting something epic. The fighting, gun/sword lay was indeed epic. I mean, amazing.

The story? Lackluster and completely underwhelming.

After the way 3 ended, there were so many possibilities for an amazing plot and epic conclusion. When I read that it was near close to a three hour run time, that's exactly what I was expecting!

Instead, they introduce a NEW, singular, villain -from seemingly nowhere; Two NEW old friends of John; and a NEW random assassin who has a pet/partner German shepherd assassin. This last one had to be a ploy to incorporate more of the action sequences from chapter 3. Bc the character was utterly useless for moving the plot, and bc of the screen time allotted to him, annoying.

My frustration is that at what could very well be the end, they're introducing all these features, but they haven't done anything with previous features. In fact, there are some that are major loose ends. The adjudicator from 3, Cassius from chapter 2, Aurelio from chapters 1&2, the head of Ruska Roma from ch.3 (the closest John has to a mother/family), and John Wicks own Pit bull .... None of these characters get even mentioned. I get scheduling conflicts, but 1 scene or even just a reference can go a long way for encapsulating a world or resolving a relationship in a pleasant way that makes an end sweeter.

This is some of the best action you're gonna see, but the writers have done nothing to bring this story arch home. We deserved better. And even if there is a fifth, based off the way they ditch character arch's, and seem allergic to FALLING action, I have little faith it will be satisfactory.

The plane doesn't land. It just crashes.",6
sujanfaster,"Wow, it had really been a while. It had been a while since I was so engrossed watching a movie in theaters. That's what I thought to myself walking out of the cinema hall after watching this. Of course Avatar was beautiful and had some great visual effects but it didn't have me at the edge of my seat. John Wick: Chapter 4 really turned out to be a great sequel amidst all of us wondering if they were stretching the franchise too much.

This movie purely stands out from its predecessors and also from most of the action movies these days because of its 'execution' (see what I did there ;-)). The story isn't anything really out of the box and it is yet again John Wick running away (and killing away) from the lot trying to kill him including the high table. The screenplay is very engaging and it almost acts like going through different levels of a game before meeting the final boss. The action set pieces are very well executed just like many other John Wick movies, but in this film the attention to detail to some of the action is at a different level. I ended up laughing at some of the action sequences just because how outrageous they were and in a good way. My brain was just unable to comprehend that level of awesomeness. The fight scene in a Berlin nightclub is probably one of the best action sequences in a movie and the background score makes it special. The action sequence around Arc De Triomphe is ridiculously good and makes you feel like you are in a fantasy ride. The cinematography is outstanding and offers some very creative perspectives in some scenes, which are worth the big screen experience. Background score and music selection is near perfect and as mentioned this film checks pretty much all the boxes in the technical departments. Another big highlight of the movie is the choice of beautiful locations. The filmmakers have made sure to give a new experience despite choosing many of the mainstream action movie locations.

There isn't much that does not work for the movie. The script isn't very new and I personally feel that some parts of the plot weren't really justifying what happened next. Sometimes, the action sequences may feel a bit too streched but that is mainly dependent on an individual's taste.

Donnie Yen's characterization as Caine might feel inconsistent at times related to his abilities. It also reminds you of Chirut Imwe from Rogue one but the chemistry between him and John Wick works out for better eventually. While Bill Skarsgard's character is intentionally obnoxious and irritating, it doesn't really create any kind of a significant threat. The antagonist and supporting roles are very well written and never get overshadowed by John Wick. Clancy Brown as Harbinger in a small role is very impactful and Marko Zaror as Chidi, the right hand man of the main antagonist is immense. Scott Adkins as a heavily prosthetic Killa offers a unique comic relief but also a unique resistance to John Wick. Hiroyuki Sanada is his usual best even in a small role and Rina Sawayama as Akira is definitely a future star in the making. Old timers and franchise veterans Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne are pleasant as always. And the main man himself, Keanu Reeves, offers great depth to the character and delivers as many punches as he can but very few lines ;-) Last but not the least ""the concierge"" Lance Reddick (god rest his soul) delivers one last classy short performance with his trademark deep voice.

John Wick Chapter 4 is a stylish, compelling and an unapologetic action flick which makes for a great theatrical experience.",9
joshuarz-98584,"Is there something I don't like from this film???

Right from the start you already know this is going to be so worth it, Lawrence fishburne making his entrance as a mfkn king introducing us to Winston and Charon letting us know there are consequences, something that stands apart from other furious franchises, skipping the consequences just makes your film not worth it and still expanding this idea all the way down to Japan where it's not only new York affected, every friendship related to john is getting punished, wow there really is no room for feelings in this business, it also raises a deep question as john wick fighting for not just living but also for a reason to keep killing, why? Is like he still thinks he has a chance even though he knows how it's all going to end, why bother? What impulses this guy so much to the point of becoming immortal, Donnie yeng knows john has lived enough and that he needs to finish this, caine easily could be the star if it wasn't for keanu these 2 guys make this film what it is, action from the beginning till the end, ""worth watching"" stays short for JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4.",10
gvlchev,"If you're a fan of the franchise, you would definitely get satisfied by the whole movie and by its ending. Even for an unprofessional eye like mine the stunts look so well choreographed and the way they're shot is so perfectly executed that gives you the feeling you're almost there(that's why I recommend you to see it on IMAX, if you have the opportunity). On the other hand, because of the length of the movie you could get exhausted by all the fighting or at least l did. That also made me think - okay, Jon Wick is a really well trained killer, but where is the source of its stamina, because I'm not sure if even a professional athlete would be capable to keep up with all of these unstoppable running, wrestling and fighting(don't forget that an UFC fight is at most 25 minutes). Nevertheless, if you watched and most importantly - liked, the previous parts, you should definitely watch the final(for now) chapter.",6
shanemessman,Reeves returns to one of his most exciting roles the one and only John wick. Awesome action coaster. The best thing we all know is the action. Choreographed perfectly. Amazing how they have taken each inch of a shot. Respect to reeves for pulling it off at a old age. The look stays same maintains the character. The car action element faltered my eyes. Watched the movie in regular still was as exciting as a premium format. Another thing I liked are the villains and how they have gave each villain a action style with swag. The best one being the chinnise man with the noodles ü§£. One flaw is the movie might be dragged for some individuals and they might not be able to enjoy especially if your not a action geek. Collections on the rise. Overall this is a event film should watch for sure!!!!,8
sauerkraut-96467,"While I think they kind-of messed up with the second and third ones, this one is as good or better than the first one! The fight scenes are outstanding, and the story makes perfect sense and gets him back to the way he was in the first movie. There is great action throughout the entire movie. I would give an A+ for the fight scenes, A+ for the script, A for the acting and directing. If you liked the first one, you have to see this one. I completes the story and doesn't leave you hanging waiting for more. I was not expecting that much after 2 and 3, but this one does deliver the goods and then some!",9
MiloSuperSpesh,"Chad is an amazing director he absolutely nailed the cinematography to emote many styles/ genres or mind blowing homages to old movies classics and a couple of parodies of the matrix series, for example a perfect anime style shot of john wick stood next to a cherry blossom tree in red light, with an equally perfect backdrop of a dark building with sharp lines from red lighting and omg JUST LOOK AT IT vibe IT'S SO WELL DONE you might have to rewind and pause this scene to check it's not animated.

In no particular order, fights are beautifully choreographed, some cyber punk ish neon rooms with a subtle daft punk vibe, a matrix call back where john fights through rain and water including big punches and punch volleys.

Utterly glorious stunt work, set pieces, keanu with nunchucks YES IT IS ACTUALLY KEANU and an equally exsquisite room clearing scene but this time it's an over head view akin to a dungeon crawler game, where keanu just annahilites bad guys with dragon breath rounds, frantic scrambling, around for cover and close quarters combat.

You might feel breathless just watching it !

Yes i could probably gush more like many other reviewers BUT now i must nit pick a few things that just didn't work or feels out of place.

The elephant in the room being lance riddicks untimely tragic passing and this follows charons tragic, imho pointless, empty death.

Kain : interesting character but a little heavy on the plot armor, what with being blind and all.

The marqius army : The marquis henchmen are like a call back to the agents / twins of the matrix, minus the sunglasses, like a who's who of type cast mercs from other action movies, and then they go even further with a 'smith' like right hand guy but man he also gets some crazy plot armor.

Scott adkins in a fat suit trying to be the matrix marovingian: The poor accent, the gold teeth, the strange mix of running away bleeding, then suddenly stops to fight, kick johns ass, then get stabbed again, runs, fights again, then just falls to his death. He certainly embraced the cringe, kind of impressive he could still do his martial arts in the suit, but oof .

The marquis: skarsgard did a great job as the big bad, the scrapping of the spoon in the tea cup, the slick heavy accent, smooth yet menacing.

Yes john wick himself is also hysterically covered in plot armor but he is the star of the movie so it's a given.

I think the wardrobe dept needs a shout out, for the AMAZING suits, like seriously those can't have been cheap to make ! Perfectly tailored to the actors even the tall beefy henchmen !

On the whole great movie but imho jw 3 is better.

R I P LANCE.",8
nitsuanox,"Yeah yeah, yeaaahhhhhh, yeah, YEAHH, yeah, I need guns, lots of guns.

Honestly I need to watch it again because all of us went to the Cinemark XD theater to watch it and it was 88 degrees Fahrenheit for the entire length of the movie. We were all sweating and felt like we were going through menopause. This made the movie seem longer and more arduous than it could have been. Great movie! Great sequels!

How many sequels are this consistent, congruent, character driven, have characters with motivation, butterfly effects, fantasy, lore, escapism, a good ending and send off.

We wanted Matrix sequels and we got John Wick!!!",10
btzwspjyg,"As much as I've enjoyed the previous John Wick installments, I feel these reviews can't be real. They overdid the fight sequences. John Wick didn't have as much as a scratch on his face till the end of the movie. Falling from buildings and getting hit by cars and being fired at with 100s of bullets and still remaining unharmed was too unrealistic.

The blind guy was even more unbelievable than anything else and was a poor addition to the franchise.

The guy with the dog had a target on John Wick throughout the movie, except when he agreed to kill him. Then he couldn't manage to kill him.

Not sure where all the henchmen got their training from, but after 3 previous movies they should've known that was not a credible place to train and their outcome was missing 10 shots and getting shot in the head themselves.",6
sjo-15,"Its as much of a John Wick film as a John Wick fan could wish for.

Very cool and moody.

Very similar to the first three movies but longer, much longer.

Loads of fight scenes - a ridiculous amount - one becomes immune to them after a while. It takes the ridiculous and then goes further. But thats what John Wick is - ridiculous fights, against ridiculous odds.

This one is mostly played seriously. Towards the ends there were some intentional jokes and some bits where the audience laughed at the ridiculousness of it all.

Hopefully this is the last one - it feels like its run its course, fun though its been.",9
pathbreakingwriter,"If you have already seen the earlier installments of John Wick franchise, you are already aware of what's coming. While the JW4 trailer do showcase the level of action you're about to see, but some of the best action scenes are not in the trailer, so you have a lot to discover as you go on a ride with John Wick on his quest to challenge the High Table.

While most people are talking about the insane level of action, let me tell you the two other factors that made this movie a cinematic treat to watch.

Lighting - Most of the movie scenes are shot at night and they are done beautifully. The neon lights contrast with the dark sky and ultra-black suits and guns and pistols and armours. It creates a new dimension of its own.

Camera Work - The cinematography by Dan Laustsen is so immersive. Just after the Paris car scene is over and when John enters a building, pay attention to how the camera moves from the moment John is on the stairs. That scene alone with a spectacular one long-shot camera work is gonna blow you apart.

Watch John Wick 4 in IMAX for the best experience.",9
aryassen,"I was looking forward to this. Keanu Reeves is great, and I've a good time with the previous John Wick movies (not so much the 3rd one, but still OK), so what's there not to like, right?

Wrong. Unfortunately. I don't want to go into the potholes, because this is not a documentary or a drama, so let me cut it some slack there right away. However, even with that headstart, things are going downhill quickly.

This is the first time when I have seen John Wick tired, weak or worn. Some of the action scenes look really silly because there is no perceivable force or momentum in John's moves. I'm sure Keanu is in excellent phisical shape, so I don't get it: sometimes it really looks like a grandpa is trying to beat up a bunch of street-kids.

Then the so-much cited world-building...oh well, we needed that as much as a mole needs sunglasses, but still: where did it derail so badly? I mean this is supposed to be a secret society, operating behind the scenes, barely leaving a trace, right? Then how come that armies (literally, small armies, plural) of assassins and henchmen are just swarming in world-famous locations, time after time? How come that there is apparently a ""Continental"" in every major city? That there is always yet another rule, which can be used to move the ""plot"" (man that was difficult to label it such) forward? If you bend the rules (your rules, btw) so many times, why would anyone invest into the characters? If they get in a pickle with seemingly no way out, we just invent another rule (or exception, or amendment, or whatever), and the job's done. It really turns any dramatic potential (not that there are many to start with) into a proper snoozefest.

OK, so not much substance or plot, Mr Wick is not who he once was, and the world building sucks....but the action scenes are still great, right? Well, kind of. Clearly not my taste, but it is evident that a lot of effort went into creating them, so I can perfectly understand if some of the viewers find them enjoyable. For me, they just went waaay to far. There are so many opponents executed (hundreds, literally), that there is no weight to it. No matter what, the bad guys drop, and John Wick walks away...gets boring after the first 150 killings or so. The complete lack of realism doesn't help, and neither does the fact that they overwrite their own set of rules in an instant if and when they deem fit (example: you can't penetrate the magic armor by bullets, but apparently you can cut and stab through it....come on now, decide already).

With all that being said, the movie does have its moments...few and far in between, yes, but still, sometimes it just does. That however doesn't justify the 3 hours I feel I have wasted watching it: I would have needed a lot more meat on the bone, some better characters, at least a bit of a reasonable plot, and some consistency at least against its own set of rules. To sum it all up, this defintiely feels like the low point of the series, and I honestly don't understand how this, in its current form, got the green light.",4
hobgoblinlol,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is better than 3, but not as good as 1 or 2. The film is entertaining enough that it doesn't feel like a 3 hour long movie but it really didn't need to be this long.

The movie has amazing visuals and settings, so many scenes can be a wallpaper especially Osaka, Cathedral, etc. The action is top-notch but a bit too excessive. It can get tedious watching Wick headshot the same generic European guy for the 50th time. That top down scene along with many others is a standout. I also really loved Donnie Yen's character and his fighting style. Scott Adkins was a good addition too. Choreography is great as always.

My main issues with the film are Nobody's character, really boring and generic, especially his dog that has massive plot armor and is shown to be invincible. Didn't we already have that with Halle Berry? Medium sized dogs can't walk off being hit by a car and tackle men 3x their size. I know it's just a movie but seeing one average dog easily kill a guy in few seconds is frustrating. Dogs aren't tigers. The main villain was also unmemorable despite Skarsgard doing a good job with what he was given.

The movie is a lot of fun, but I just can't give it an 8 as much I want to. It definitely has flaws and borrows a lot from previous films. Still a great watch. 7/10. You can see the passion and dedication from everyone who worked on this.",7
vpashokkumar,"Everyone in the movie gets killed, but they return quickly and continue fighting. All of them are superheroes with build-proof bodies or dresses, which is dame comedy.

Three long hours of killing without any acting, and the only purpose is it kills, but everyone will keep him until the end, oh God. John wick started with the killing of his beloved wife's gift ""The dog"" which is a great comedy but good to watch the action. This movie's action is directly taken from the video game is too much. They target the gaming group and not the other action movie lovers but why do the reviews and rating groups consider this movie as the best is rising big question.",6
kamalmanvi,"I was waiting for this movie for a long time and when it finally came, I couldn't able to watch it due to personal reasons. But after months, I finally watched it today. And it didn't disappoint me at all. This is my genre of movies. Keanu Reeves is just incomparable and this man motivates me by performing his own stunts. Action choreography is as always brilliant. But the best part is cinematography. All the actors are really good in their respective roles. I couldn't realize Scott Adkins was also in the movie. Impressive! Story is well written.

This is my favorite action franchise without any doubt.

And for Cheron, He will always be remembered. Rest in Peace!",10
adityamindstein,"This movie defines the action genre. This movie is made to watch only in cinemas or you will be cheating to yourself. The action sequences were madness and a lot of stylish music and settings were there throughout the movie. Never seen more stylish movie in all sense from start to finish. The theme of John Wick as a God was still intact as he just couldn't die and everyone fears him. Even a city full of people couldn't kill this mad man. Only thing I don't like about this or few other John Wick movies was that he doesn't has a motive to not die. A back story why he is so damn robust could be shown or maybe in future installments.

One crazy casino scene was so mad and my absolute favorite which shows the ridiculousness of this franchise which is so uber cool. Only madmax fury road was another mad movie like this in action genre. If this is not the best action movie ever than definitely not far behind either. There is only one way to watch such movies and that is in cinemas.",10
cloliver864,"So while I would highly recommend seeing this film in the theaters I would like to state what I thought did and didn't work.

First, the action scenes and fighting choreography was great, but there is sometimes too much of a good thing. The film seemed to be redundant at times as John would fight a bunch of guys for 20 minutes straight then drive to another location and fight a bunch of guys for 20 minutes straight.

The new characters introduced in this film were pretty cool and it was great to see actors like Scott Adkins and Donnie Yen get cast in a major block buster after paying their dues for many years in lesser known films.

The filming location were great and and the cinematography was top notch.

John came across in the film as somewhat one dimensional as he barely spoke 300 words in the nearly 3 hour film, but of course actions speak louder than words.

Personally I would have liked to have seen the film dedicate a little more time to show the history and inner workings of the high table as I have always felt that this mysterious and ritualistic organization really helped make the films unique.

I'm summary, god action film, but missed some opportunities to make it really memorable.",7
Wirxaw,"I've heard mostly negative things about the movie, and, frankly, I didn't expect much when I bothered to watch it. I expected less. The sequels were matrix-esque, I can barely remember what went on there, all I remember is the meme-able finale of third movie, and I thought that the series had reached its creative limit. It seems like Reeves and Stahelski thought the same, when they argued with the producers over the narrative of the movie, because the latter have already announced the fifth movie. And while they tried to make the best of the situation, they weren't allowed to... do it respectfully.

First of all - the action in this movie is good. Not ""realistic"" good, or ""fun"" good or ""epic"" good. It's not the original John Wick, which could do more with less. It's not some Ip Man or a proper fighting movie. It's not even something properly fantastic, like Equilibrium or Matrix. It's more.... video-game good. Like this is a live-action adaptation of a nonexistent video game. So many scenes have been designed exactly like some GTA or Payday events, there were shots of various arcadey games and even isometric ones. Not gonna lie, if the game industry wasn't dead in the production\publisher department, someone could make a fortune with this franchise. So if you don't expect John Wick, but more like some Ready Player One, Deadpool or Free Guy action - you are going to be entertained. For what it's worth, I wouldn't say that the level of quality has dropped to Fast and Furious levels. This is done much more creatively. But, of course, you have to keep in mind video game rules and stormtrooper aim.

Plotwise.... there's not much to say. Without spoilers, that is. But even with spoilers - still not much. The movie goes from one reason to have an action scene to another. That's... about it. I liked the cast, even the aging characters. I can't say it was under-acted, though not a whole of a lot was required, obviously. Donnie Yen was, as always, a pleasure to watch.

And now to the problems. Like I said... it wasn't done respectfully. I don't remember the sequels, but everyone knows that they sucked. And everyone has seen essays and lectures written and narrated on youtube about why the original John Wick was such a hit. And that wasn't so much the action, the action there was rather modest(compared to this movie) and limited to a few scenes, but the music, the immersion, that atmosphere of that movie was what excited people. Pure dialogue scenes, mimicry, perfectly matching music. It is all the ingredients of an epic movie.

They are missing here. Sound-wise the movie is next to mute. Most noticeable is the transition to credits and the credits themselves. They don't reflect on the franchise, they just reflect on a movie, like some Fast and Furious. Like some routine milking. Good for modern standards, for 100mil$. But this franchise deserved more. Still - it could've been worse. Don't get your hopes, don't expect miracles and you will be entertained. Bread and circuses. And there'll always be more where that came from.",7
Moonstrike9,"The plot of this one was pretty good, the scenes were incredible and very cool, and the fight sequences were very solid, but there were way too many. About halfway through the movie I was already getting bored of them. Most of the actors were good, some of the characters were a little cartoonish, but perhaps the biggest sin of this movie is the absolutely ham-fisted, cringey, awkward, wooden dialogue John Wick has in this movie. I love Keanu Reeves, and maybe I'm missing something and the character is supposed to be weirdly emphasizing everything he says, but every time he spoke in the movie I was suddenly and violently jerked out of the story. I think I even rolled my eyes at one point and nearly laughed at others.",4
mquo77,"The first movie had so much more than this. I was genuinely surprised by that first movie: original, exciting yet realistic fight sequences, a main character and plot you were invested in, and although Keanu isn't a great actor, his lack of dialogue and a great supporting cast more than made up for it.

The 2nd and 3rd movies took us on a journey into this mysterious underground world, but set up more than it delivered. The action scenes were starting to get a little repetitive and unrealistic, but the intrigue of the plot kept us interested.

My expectation was that this movie would deliver a lot more with regards to story, but it fell flat. Nothing that was set up previously was resolved in a satisfactory way. The action scenes were ridiculous, the characters unoriginal, and the movie was just way too long. I was literally yawning as hundreds of supposed hit-men who couldn't hit anything were killed again and again.

Before this 4th instalment, I was thinking of adding the John Wick franchise to my Blu-ray collection, but now I will just buy the first one as it works well as a standalone movie and is far superior to the rest.",5
coolcuk,"No spoilers here but wow! Amazing! I was very disappointed with John Wick 3 and felt the series declining, this is a complete step up from that film.

I love my action films, especially martial arts and this has things I've never even seen in Hong Kong action cinema before. So glad Donnie Yen also was able to shine, I expected him to have a few scenes then be out but he's along for a large chunk of the film without giving anything away. The choreography is on another level and blows everything else out of water. The story is also well written and there isn't just action for no reason. I recommend watching in IMAX if you can.",10
godsnames,"It is not only outstanding but rather mind-blowing in terms of camerawork, so much so that at times your jaw drops to the ground. The lighting of the scenes are also state-of-the-art, making pictures as real as dreamlike, monumental, just like when you enter a cathedral, look up up and say: wow! I do not know how much CGI was involved in that case, but: wow!

As for the story, it is far from the first picture, yet much more convincing then the 2nd and 3d instalment of the franchise. It is, mind you, extremely violent, full of killing, so be prepared. The camerawork, the lighting and the editing achieve its goal of looking like a graphic novel. The music in that terms is far behind but, thanks for God, at least it's not irritating.

I'd say this one may not match the first episode (story like) but way-way better as a picture.

A fantastic visual achievement.",8
sosrivi,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is a love letter to action film-making and every action cinema lover's wet dream. The cinematography is Oscar-worthy, and the neo-noir genre has never looked better on the big screen as the bold and vibrant colors make each scene pop. The action choreography utilizes 100% of each and every set design used in the film to incorporate drama, thrill and also comedy. This movie has everything you could ever ask for - guns, knives, nun chucks, katanas, martial arts, cars, flamethrowers, bare hands etc. The stunt work is jaw-dropping and adrenaline inducing, especially a stunt that was performed on a staircase on the later half of the movie. It's pure gold.""",7
bradys-76532,This movie was just amazing. The stunts are phenomenal. The action is amazing. Considering this film was nearly three hours long you would be surprised how quickly the film goes. The John Wick franchise some how manages to up itself in terms of action as each sequel is released. Some the set pieces used in the film were visually stunning and the fight choreography was terrific. I won't spoil anything although the third act was the best part of the film in terms of action and suspense. I personally think this is the best action franchise since the Jason Bourne films. Although unlike those films the John Wick film series has managed to not go stale whatsoever four films in. An easy 10/10 would recommend to action film enthusiasts.,10
ringdrossel,"As the main antagonist says himself John Wick has no motivation. This stays true until the end.

And without spoiling anything - the ending makes his entire quest meaningless. Which is really bad because now all movies before are meaningless as well.

The action is fun until it gets so unbelievable that it hurts. There were even some scenes the entire cinema laughed during his rather serious fights. Especially the last hour it drags on and on.

One thing worth mentioning though is the amazing camerawork. The idea to film the action scene in one of the houses in Paris from the top is pure genius and feels fresh.

All in all I would rather recommend watching it on a streaming service than going to the cinema.",5
faridhamidi-74537,"This is a must see movie. JW: Chapter 4 continues to deliver on the outstanding action and fantastic performances. I would also argue that this is the most visually stunning of all the movies. Hardly any single minute is wasted multiple great build ups and payoffs throughout the movie. If you've already been a fan of the first 3 movies, I cannot recommend seeing this one enough. And for any newcomers: I just cannot emphasize how superb the JW franchise is as a whole.

The epic fighting sequences are so well done that it felt like watching a well choreographed fighting ballet.

It is indeed the best action Movie i have ever seen! Period.",10
iamianiman,"John Wick 4 gives it all with its never-before-seen action stunts that will take your breathe... literally. There are some stunts that are fresh from the oven, it's the first time it's been done in the history of filmmaking. The pacing is frenetic and the action sequences are jaw-droppingly awesome, you'll never get enough of them.


A special shoutout to the cinematography team. Every time Mr Wick is punching, kicking, smashing and every other verb you can think of, the cameras have their ways of putting us on a ride; like a curious kid standing close only feet apart watching everything happening before his eyes. It is breathtaking, it is vibrant and it really feels like we're there with John Wick.








However, because there isn't many long-running characters left, it may be a drag for some audience. John Wick 4 isn't the same like the other 3, it is heavier, bloodier, and its neo-noir looks are refined and richer, it'll make you feel you're watching Blade Runner 2049 instead. Some will appreciate its tonal shift but others won't accept the new look, feel and heavy-themed stories.





Verdict: Defining the action genre, John Wick Chapter 4 offers an orgy of violence, nail-biting kinetic action sequences that will set the bar for the rest of the one man army movies in decades to come. It may not be THE best John Wick film but WOW, this is first class entertainment at its finest.",8
hydralien-40230,"On the positive side, cinematography is great, it is fast-paced and all the scenes and angles look gripping and impressive. Additionally, they really either shot most of it in Paris or made up a pretty convincing CGI version of it, so also looks authentic. Core actors are still doing great job portraying their characters, and some additional roles are also quite solid. Almost-3-hours runtime might be a bit much, but not too bad overall as it balances the story development with action scenes fairly well.

On the less positive, the fights are a lot less inventive than in previous installments - it's mostly ""shoot them in the head"" and that's about it. No killing people with a horse or a book or a carrot. Wait no the carrot is from another movie. Still sad though. The traffic scene around Arc de Triomphe was a nice exception, but even that was fairly monotonous. What makes it palatable is the fights are mixed with story development, but the fight themselves are quite boring.

Additionally, some characters are either not explained at all (and neither is their motivation) like Nobody, or disappear and leave the story lines dangling (like Akira), or just annoying and pathetic (like Marquis), which makes the whole story feel a lot less solid and definitive comparing to the previous installments (or at least comparing to chapters 1 and 2).

Overall it's a decent continuation, and a good evolution of the storyline, but somehow less exciting than the previous chapters.",6
s-serby,"But still a good film. The originality of the John Wick movies was the realism ( or as close as possible ) of the action scenes. In this 4th movie the images and the sets are better but for a grown up, the fight scenes are sometimes hilarious in every way possible. Also, the fact that Caine is blind erases by half his credibility ... a must not have done in my opinion. Thumbs way up for Bill Skarsgard and Shamier Anderson. I don't know if they should have stopped at the third, it is still entertaining but it takes a down slide road of the saga. Not even close to the second, which I think it still is the best of all 4.",6
sharmaprakhar-48902,"Keanu Reeves is my idol & he was made for this movie , bow down to the best action movie I have ever watched , the best from beginning till end my mind just blown away , cinematography with pure gangster music is something else to witness it.

Best John wick movie , Pure action Pure acting Pure badass character Pure heart from inside but can burn anyone whoever steps forward to hurt his one's , In the end I just want to say that thank you Keanu for delivering such badasss movie , now times Hollywood cinema downgraded a little bit but actor like you & Tom cruise bring back the Hollywood to its pure class ,",10
theodore62,"Let me preface this review by saying that if Keanu Reeves had not been cast to play John Wick in this series, I would not have watched any of them. Action movies are generally not my thing. Even then, it is the premise--a man avenging the death of his dog--that keeps me coming back for more. To say the very least, I am a dog guy. With that out of the way, I want to extoll the virtues of this film, which are many. Visually, it is stunning. Set after set, location after location, everything here is a feast for the eyes. Also, too, the fight scenes are impeccably choreographed, and in general are extremely creative, the techno club and the Arc de Triomphe scenes being highlights for this punter. Also, too, the inclusion of the mercenary with his faithful attack dog provides an interesting shadow dimension to the film and offers up what is to me the best moment in the film, one which reestablishes Wick's moral center and made me want to cheer. To anyone who has the audacity to suggest that the film is over the top I say, This movie is over the top of the top! It's an absolutely audacious wild ride, filled with wit and mayhem, and though it clocks in at over two and a half hours, there's never a dull moment. Highly recommended. Keanu remains the coolest.",9
Randy-Dreammaker,"Yet another John Wick movie, the longest and most boring of them all. Sad to have to give John Wick 4 lowly 6 Stars, down from the 8 Stars of the first two and 7 Stars of the third.

John Wick 4 pulls so much out of the Matrix visualization, scenes and storyline, it could have almost been a new Matrix movie. There was definitely a scene that reminded me of Neo and Agent Smith fighting in the rain, except this time it was John Wick fighting the most limber fat man to ever exist.

Like the most recent Matrix movie it failed to keep me entertained with a sub-par story line that at times introduced characters that reminded me of the early Batman movies, like Tim Burton's Penguin or Mr. Freeze.

It was like watching four different movies for the price of one.

Particularly nonsensical are the scenes where Wick fights a fat guy who is more limber than a high school chair leader, and the Matrix like dance club scenes where people just dance around mindlessly while guns are blazing and swords and axes fly around dropping people dead at their feet.

The story simply gave me no reason to care what happened in this movie and that is a fatal flaw at least from a screenwriting perspective.

The first two John Wick movies were great because we knew what John Wick's motivations were, they gave us something to care about, something we could all relate to, revenge against someone who killed our spouse or killed our favorite pet. A man who just wanted out of the his ugly past and instead had his house burned down, a guy who wanted a fresh start.

But John Wick 4 didn't give us anything to care about.

I enjoyed seeing Lawrence Fishburne with Keanu again, they often have great chemistry together, but Fishburne's camo, similar to his previous in the John Wick series, didn't add anything of value to the story. It makes sense that they had him appear to add to the Matrix connection of the Keanu, and they didn't want that to be become a distraction, but if they are going to star him, it would have been great if they could of given him some value and a meaningful reason to be in the story.

I admit, I was skeptical after John Wick 3 if they could give me reason to continue caring about the motivation of John, and I was right, they couldn't deliver.",6
jsy-54887,"Honestly, I feel like the title to this review is enough. The fight scenes in this movie are the best they possibly could be. These are the kinds of stunts where I could see Tom Cruise watching this film in theaters and going, ""Challenge accepted."" The best word that comes to mind to describe the first few action set pieces is: ""beautiful."" I realize that what was happening on screen was very violent, but the movements and the methodical timing of them reminded me of an intricate dance, and I mean that in the highest of praise.

I feel like the word masterpiece gets tossed around a lot, but this movie is a masterpiece. I believe this will become the action movie to beat for a while.",9
cinmartel,"Reading things like ""a new standard for fight/action scene"" or ""best action movie ever"" comments, and the 8.1 current score on Imdb makes me think and worry about our collective minds lol. Has intelligence or critical thinking completely been wiped from the general population? Is the audience devoted to these films made only of 14 years old? Is there a deliberate will from film production companies to feed nonsense and stupidity onto our society for a reason?

JWc4 is ridiculously bad. The storyline and the general attitude of the writers/producers thoughout the film is like ""ok our audience is high-on-something anyway, so who cares""? Mr. Reeves acting defines a new level of ""wooden"" and it hurt the eyes. He moves in front of the camera in the ""why am i here?"" fashon. Then he gets hit at least by a dozen running cars, jumps off a building smashing himself on top of a parked car below (which ofc he destroys on landing) and he just keeps standing back up in a matter of seconds and keeps running and fighting like nothing happened. Oh wait, by the final scenes he's limping... The writers/prducers must have though that should be enough to make up for the continuing utter nonsense hahaha. Oh what about him fighting 30/40 adversaries in a room but conveniently being only attacked by one at the time or in tandem at most?! Sure buddies.

Now regarding the fighting scenes.... They were SO bad and ridiculous that I must 100% agree with those saying ""a new standard in fighting scenes""... if they are being sarcastic.

End of rant: This movie is basically on par with those cartoons showing 24/7 on kids channel for 5-12 years old audience. An adult audience with that level of perception is worrysome. These production companies must old their audience completely braindead considering these offerings.",N/A

luissinux,"I expected a better film. First of all, I think the fighting scenes and the handling of weapons are very good, as I was used to from the other parts. Also, the scenery is very good and vivid. I also find it good that many of the characters appear again. However, I also have some criticism, so most of the fight scenes are too exaggerated and one-sided. Without exception, all shots at john wick go nowhere and thus the scenes were always very boring. But I also have to complain about the story, because some things do not really make sense and some actions do not sign the actual intentions of the characters. It's a shame that this film series finds such an end.",5
alshahria,"Absolutely phenomenal. Huge respect for how they did justice to all the characters, JW4 lives up to its predecessor's. By far the most Best in JW franchise I've seen. This deserves to get all the Oscar's how good it is. The direction,the action, Cinematic all are top notched. Nothing less expected. I had great high hopes for this movie and im not disappointed .Loved this movie, I'd recommend everyone to watch JW1,2,3 then watching the 4th film will give you the best experience.

Best movie by far this year , this gonna be HUGE HIT.

Happy watching.

andischoon-86512,"As with every John Wick movie, this one has a thin story, lots of cliches, stereotypical characters (even the blind warrior is here!). But just as the first 3 movies, it does not matter. The story works well enough to make sense of the amazing fight scenes that we all want to see. Again many (maybe a hundred or more, you will not keep track of it) trained fighters die to the hands of John Wick and his colleagues. Japanese swords, a beautiful scene filmed from top down involving incendiary shotgun ammunition, another equal parts cute and deadly dog, an amazing car scene and much more. The choreography was on point again, although some of the armored foes looked a bit goofy while obviously not hitting the old man Keanu to not ruin the scene. The blind guy (played by Donnie Yen!) was a bit too good at feeling his surroundings, very much like Daredevil. His movements and fights were on par with every scene Donnie is in, though. Overall, the best movie you can see right now if you like over the top, martial art-style shooting and stabbing of countless nobodies. Don't think too hard about the story and the absence of police after minutes of intense shootings in the middle of metropolitan cities and you will enjoy it!",8
kimberlyely-27550,"In John Wick Chapter Four, Chad Stahelski directed all four John Wick films as well as producing this time. The film stars Keanu Reeves from the Matrix, Bill Skarsgard from the It franchise and Eternals as well as Ian McShane from Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides. John is Excommunicado which means the high table will pay a good amount of money to anyone who manages to kill him. John wants his freedom from the high table so his plan was to assassinate all 12 members so he could achieve that however he soon finds out the only way to earn his freedom is by challenging the Marquis's played by Bill Skarsgard in single combat. The rule is that you have to go get a crest from your family but his family refuses to give it to him until he earns their loyalty again. He is tasked with assassinating someone who killed the Cadia's son, John achieves this task with ease. He is to meet the Marquis at sunrise but the city doesn't make it easy. People fight him in the streets, he gets run over by cars, falls off buildings and as he's going to the set location he continually gets knocked down the 200 stairs. He acted more like superman without powers instead of a realistic man. Mister nobody played by Shamier Anderson and Kaine played by Donnie Yen helps John kill the people on the stairs. Donnie Yen did an excellent job as an assassin since he played a blind man. When it came to the final fight mister nobody looks on just like the spectators do in the Hunger Games. It comes down to John and his two friends Kaine and Winston played by Ian McShane. They all want their freedom for different reasons, in the end all of the men win in their own way. There is lots of action with John killing 140 people throughout the film. Between doing his own stunts and being the main character in two big action franchises, this is what made Reeves known as an action star. Only time will tell what he decides to star in next.",8
GroovyDrew,"Amazing movie in every sense of the work. More action than any of the other Wick flicks let alone any movie of all time. Great mix of storytelling drama, action, big name actors, soundtrack (omg), cinematic landscapes, combat, weaponry, blood, guts and more. Spectacular performances from all stakeholders including Ian McShane (Winston) who seemed to steal the show in every scene he was in. Donnie Yen was also incredible. I deducted 0.5 stars simply because the limited involvement of Lawrence Fishburne. He was missed. Other than this there are disappointments here.

What a blast of a film, fantastic action sequences and story. It's an absolute masterpiece. Keanu Reeves is brilliant. This is how action movies should be made.

I can't even tell you how incredible this film really is. The artistry of the direction and the cinematography are magnificent. The stunts are choreographed to perfection. It's beautiful!. Delivers a thrilling and immersive experience that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. Despite being the fourth movie in the franchise, it's clear that the filmmakers haven't run out of tricks, and the result is a movie that is as fresh and exciting.

It's a masterpiece.",10
darkalo84,"I feel tired and exhausted after watching this endless succession of firefights and fight scenes that take place in a world populated only by mindless NPCs. Videogame-like pedestrians, partygoers and car drivers that just keep ignoring the carnage taking place all around them, driving past or running over dozens of bad guys with guns and assault rifles.... As if nothing was happening at all around them.

Where are all the police officers in this world?? Not a single police car showing up at any location at all. Ludicrous.

The guys that made this movie are just videogame junkies. They have spent way too much time playing with cartoonish characters that fall off a building, land on a van and stand up like nothing with zero bones broken just because.... I don't know, the John Wick's health and energy bars keep replenishing themselves as the time goes by.

Somebody at the helm should have watched movies like John Frankenheimer's Ronin for a little bit of inspiration.

Jon Wick 3 Parabellum was lots of fun and felt like a great cinematic experience because aside endless and exhausting fighting scenes it continued and followed a story woven through 2 previous movies. Because the storyline didn't feel contrived and really felt like a conclusion, because it made sense and because John had a clear, defined and achievable purpose. And also because the world and characters of this Universe were opened up, expanded and we got to see new interesting characters and locations.

But part 4 just recycles some things from part 3 and try to stretch the bubble gum just a bit too much. I thought Lawerence Fishburne was to play a greater role but he is there just for fan service. It almost seemed like John was out there killing for the sake of killing for 3 straight hours. Period.

And I cannot fully convey my astonishment at this world of Parisien NPCs that cannot be bothered by the thunderous sound of blazing bullets and the corpses piling up on the roads in the early hours of the morning nearby one of the main touristic attractions of Paris. Does anybody live in those places? Nahhh... Duels and events organized by criminal organizations can now take place everywhere they want anytime without any people showing up or giving two-pence about any bloodshed taking place around them. Seems like mafia bosses are in control of everything and made Police disappear out of the face of planet Earth.

John Wick part 4 is just a tiresome and endless repetitive choreographed battle that makes as much sense as sleeping with a tuxedo before going to play basketball with some friends at a golf course.",6

therealdklo,"I seem to be in the minority here but I thought that this was a very good but not awesome movie. As an action movie, it's amazing, but as a John Wick installment, I feel that it is somewhat lacking.

I enjoyed the fight choregraphy and I really appreciate them bringing in Donnie Yen, but I find that , when compared to the first John Wick for example, Keanu's acting seem to be much more cringe in this one. His lines are painfully forced monosyllabic and/or one sentence answers that seem to be almost FORCED coming out of his mouth, and seriously compare his dialogue with the first movie and you'll see it's night and day.

I also find that the movie has become a bit too bloated, with unnecessary fights being put in, with many of those fight scenes not necessarily involving John Wick himself, and a lot of plot inconsistencies are just swept under the rug (why was the Elder replaced? Why was he so easily reach and assassinated this time around? How have we never heard of the Marquis until now? What happened to the Adjudicator?).

The film is simultaneously too long but still inadequately explains the hanging plot lines while continuing to add new lore randomly out of nowhere.

The action sequences are still amazing, but now it seems a bit...tired, I may be wrong here but I found the action in the previous movies to be much more satisfying and punchier. In the end, I find that it didn't live up to its hype as ""the greatest John Wick movie ever"".",7
PavanKV,"John Wick 4- Other than human defying logic with unlimited lifeline for John as he fires and kills 300 hitmen along with few others, and no bones breaking while stumbling down 200+ steps and getting back up/ or falling from upper floor of 100 to 200 feet, the movie works spectacularly well.

Action sequences are at its peak one has ever experienced- from sword fighting to bullets flying to kick boxing. This movie is violent and pretty long (2 hrs, 45 mins).

Background music, sound effects, camera angles from the top view during fight scenes are simply astounding (watched it in Dolby Atmos screen). The entire theater was reverberating with amazing sound effects, with plenty of goosebumps.

Climax is at its best and could be debatable.

Keanu Reeves delivers an skillful art through death defying action stunts. His hard work can be seen during every scene.

Donnie Yen brings his best with his casually cool action sequences.

This movie is for hard core action oriented, eye popping, patiently waiting for a long action sequences, and lots of logic kept at home type of fans. Enjoy at your own risk!",9
Shubh9019,"Baba Yaga is back and is so ruthless that you won't be able to get your eyes of him.

This movie raised the bar for action movies to a whole new level.

The movie delivers exactly what the fans want, i.e., insane action.

John wick with guns. John wick with nunchucks. John wick in cars. John wick on bikes. Everything what fans want.

Now talking about the plot, it was not engaging enough. Well that's always been a problem or rather we can say one of the lesser focused aspects of the franchise.

Most of the charecters were under-utilised except Donnie Yen.

Few moments were there where you will notice that there is no logic and basically John wick is a superhuman but the action is soooo well choreographed that it steals the show.

Overall it's a really entertaining movie.

I would not say it's the best of the franchise but yes I can say it is one of the best action movies ever made.

disnotbetty-10195,"John Wick is still on the run, hiding underground in New York City and as he is preparing to get revenge against the High Table. The price on his head is ever increasing. But there new players in this Chapter 4.

After Wick kills ""the one who sets above the Table"" Enter a new leader, Marquis De Gramont (Bill Skarsg√•rd) The high table gives De Gramont unlimited power and resources to find and to execute John Wick at any cost.

With very few friends he can trust, John Wick goes to Japan and his friend Shimazu Koji (Hiroyuki Sanada) hides Wick at his Osaka Continental Hotel.

But everyone that helps Wick becomes a target of the High Table and is executed and so most of his friends have turned into enemies.

Wick fights his way out of literally armies of assassins. This movie left and nothing out... car chases, motorcycles, martial arts, guns, swords, knives, bow and arrows, battle ax, nunchucks, flamethrowers guns, and even a walking cane....and a pencil! This is a action movie Junkies dream come true!

The movie runs a little bit long, almost 3 hours, and is even more brutally violent than the previous films. The violence got almost ridiculous. The entire movie is a bloody Slaughter Fest! I became jaded to the overload. But then I realize that is exactly what has happened to John Wick and that is the whole point of the film. Wick has lost everything he cares about and has become numb and totally blinded by hate. He just wants revenge and he will not stop until everyone is dead. ""All of this for what? Because of a puppy?""",8
jumperjames-51960,"After a drop off in story quality a bit with parts 2 and 3, John Wick is doing what he does best - building up a huge body count.

A totally coherent plot is not necessary for these. However it is nice to see a modicum of effort involved. Our story here will not win any awards, but it's just a series of flimsy excuses to have endless fight scenes play out. Lots of ammunition is expended, lots of people are kicked, thrown around and punched. And if you enjoy seeing people meeting an unfortunate encounter with a vehicle (moving or stationary), you will not be disappointed.

All the John Wick films have a 1990's era Homg Kong action movie vibe. Other than maybe the first, this one captures that feel the best of the bunch.",9

People were falling off great heights and getting hit by cars. And they were getting hit pretty hard too. I imagine the stunt men were also paramedics so once they did their stunt they would just patch themselves up and do it all over again. This movie runs three hours long. Keanu Reeves kept his lines pretty short, but kept the action coming. This movie is full of excellent action scenes, a couple of my favorites being the fight in the middle of traffic, and the one in the dance club. Another aspect I loved during this movie was that it sort of seemed like it had inspiration from video games, where the main characters, or assassins, had their own unique personality and abilities, their own special skillset, and were still connected through this underground network. The tracker was definitely the best character because the dog was the highlight of the movie. This dog was so well coordinated at attacking nuts that I almost thought it was possible to train my Shih Tzu to do the same thing. I still haven't quite figured out how Caine is not able to see where he is walking, but can fight perfectly and read cards.",9

Now the bad, I get the bullet proof clothes, but to be shot repeatedly with no real reaction, too jump out of a third or fourth story window, half land on a car, grunt a few times and run off, really!!!! What made the first one so good was that it could be possible, no superpowers just John Wick being John Wick.

They did bring back some is the minimalist dialog though, the first had just enough, but not to much, and this was the same. 2 and 3 were too..... wordy. Well done acknowledging and adapting to that writers.

ahmadwael-28041,"The Cinematography, the writing, the combat and the casting, everything was very well made. A perfect movie. Everyone in this cast played their part very very good. Movies like this don't come often and this one will be remembered and mentioned as one of the best action movies of all time. The dedication and hard work that they went threw to make some of those fight scenes need to be appropriated. It was a magnificent movie and I highly recommend it to everyone. With some movies the first part is always the best and the movie get worse as they go on but not with John wick. With John wick it just gets better and better. Masterpiece.",10
AZThunder,"""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is undoubtedly the best one of the four John Wick movies. It has everything the other three had but excuted better, action, characters, cinematography, the tense moments, all of these things has showed a significant improvement making chapter 4 stand above its predecessor.

This movie is definitely not a lazy or a cheap entry that try to use it's name for a quick cash or easy views, its quite the opposite, it's a project of passion and professionality, which you can see from the variety of the characters, the variety of its scenery and the variety of the action scenes. This movie always try to stay fresh, the pace is always changing, from a gun fight to a hand combat then a sowrd fight to a car chase....etc, John Wick Chapter 4 never try to repeat itself and that's incredible for a three hours action movie.

However Chapter 4 doesn't stray far away from the other three movies and it still very much a John Wick movie, this of course a good thing if you're a John Wick fan but if you didn't like the first three movies you most likely won't enjoy this one either. For me personally chapter 4 inherited the same problem i had with the other john wick movies, and that problem is simply: the action is too much and too long.

As well done the action as it is, it's just too much, there is too much happening in the screen at the same time giving you too much to see but no time to recollect yourself and no time to think about what is actually is happening, but not just that, the action in this movie takes way too long before any stops in-between, my brain can't help but feel numb after a while of watching, it takes too long my brain even start to go blank most of the time and i lose my focus in the movie ending up thinking about anything else but the movie itself. I know many people like the movie for its packed, chaotic and fast action but sadly for me i just can never stay focus and enjoy most what John Wick movies try to offer.

Admittedly John Wick gave us a three terrific movies, one of the most known and publer franchise in the past decade and its only gotten better with addition of chapter 4. It will probably change many movies coming from the future, many movies will be compared to the John Wick movies because it left a huge finger print that will most likely have an effect in this coming era of action films.

I respect the John Wick movies and mostly respect Chapter 4 but sadly i can't seem to enjoy it like many did.",6
thomasheaney,"Once again John Wick delivers what we want, a scene to scene action packed thrill ride. However its run time is far too long, leaving us with elongated action scenes that could have been cut shorter.

The film really does drag you into its fast paced and violent world, yet keeps you adrenaline going so long that it becomes tiring.

It has a satisfying ending and does a great job at keeping the legend of John Wick alive. I would however take a happy break from this franchise even though I have looked forward to every instalment.

Lets face it, we know most of the cast and they are amazing and skilful as usual and the new members of the cast really do add a lot which is great.

If you have enjoyed the previous instalments then you will most likely love this film, but if you are not really a fan then an almost 3 hour Wick film is most likely not for you.

Enjoy or avoid, just respect the art.",8
Sudarshan_Pawar,"John Wick Chapter 4 comes with even more minutes-long action packed scenes.

The action sequences are innovative and pleasing to the eyes. The music complements the action scenes and gets you involved in the film.

More than eighty percent of the movie is just eye-pleasing fight scenes that we have never seen anywhere in any movie before.

The director Chad Stahelski has done a great job directing this movie, and of course Keanu Reeves delivers perfect action shots.

Bill Skarsg√•rd (the clown from the IT movie) also did good acting in this movie. Shamier Anderson and his dog in the movie are another add-on to the story to watch.

A feast for action movie lovers.

In the end, this is a movie you can't miss.",9
Red_khalkhal,"I can summarize this movie in these lines Wick killed 437 ennemies in a melee-range gunfight without taking damage!!!???

Wick is ammune to gravity and crushing. Have been falling from hights and hit by cars if a normal human was hit by or fall of. He d be in grave for sure. He stands up every time not even with a slight injury or dizziness. He litteraly continues fighing like nothing happenebed. Those hits and falls coule shake even a marvel hero!!!

The whole movie is about wick fighing huge numbers of assassins in middle of public places and streets. However we haven t seen a single cop!!!

7000 bullets were shot at him. None managed to hit his head and hand at least. When.",4
ashishagupta,"The movie as a whole isn't too bad, especially when compared to other action franchises. The story and screenplay is written by a committee of business executives and a moronic focus group and not by artists. Consequently, some aspects of this movie are clearly a labor of love, where I imagine the artists got creative control. Other aspects of the this movie are a huge let down, especially given the high expectations that fans of this franchise had.

The good stuff: (1) The cinematography is stunning. For a pure action movie, this is by far the best cinematography I've ever seen in this genre.

(2) The action choreography is good. It is a John Wick movie after all. The actors have put in blood, sweat and tears.

The okay stuff: (3) There are a lot of action scenes with multiple main characters and they deliver an intense performance.

(4) The movie tries to play with the soundtrack by infusing modernish elements. I appreciate the effort to experiment. However, they messed up the soundtrack. It lacks coherence and context.

The bad stuff: (5) The script is beyond obnoxiously bad. Whoever wrote the screenplay lacked sufficient time or brains, probably both.

(6) They did attempt to cover plot holes, but they did so by adding a couple of lines of dialogue to explain away each plot hole. Since these were after thoughts, they stick out like a sore thumb in the natural flow of the story.

(7) Given the duration of the action sequences as a whole, there isn't sufficient variety. Things get very repetitive.

(8) No love or understanding of principal characters. The writer is pretty bad at plot development and absolutely criminally bad at character development.

In summary, the movie shows the battle behind the scenes between the studio executives (the high table), who demand that plot and character development be butchered with extremely prejudice for the sake of money and power, and the artists ( the assassins), who try desperately to create meaning in their life and their work. Unfortunately, we all work under the High Table, always under the High Table, try as an artist may in vain to answer the calling of his heart.",7
christianadrianponce,"Many plans to seek, kill and destroy John Wick but no one can!

Was that it? Send more! Bring it on!

An excellent and perfect sequel of the John Wick franchise.

Full of action and fight scenes as always - one of the best out there.

Main character - Mr. Wick is full of grit, determination, unwavering strength and hope for freedom.

I personally loved how Keanu gives life to characters he portrays - from Matrix series to this - and many other movies!

Mr. Keanu Reeves a.k.a. Jonathan / John Wick / Jardani / BABA YAGA / Boogeyman always deliver and never ever disappoint!

P. S. He's a #LovingHusband and #FurParent too!",9
srini-chem007,"John Wick is for Action Lovers

The stunt sequence in Japan hotel, German club, Paris road and the last duel are just awesome. Kudos to the team.

Though many logical mistakes and unbelievable stunts are there in this movie, it is a treat to watch.

The mortality rate of John wick killing is increased and he becomes more immortal.

The stunt sequence, the action choreography, the camera angles and the background score saves the movie highly.

The Stunts are just awesome especially the car chase and the action. The Dog connect continues.

Though it looks silly many times, it never gets bored

John Wick is a Brand, John Wick is an Emotion

Just enjoy the Action.",7
morozviktor,"According to the plot, it simply does not exist, 1.5 hours of massacre and corpses. Didn't check it out. Actors are good but the movie is game. Fights and fights and fights....what's the point? This hasn't been filmed for a long time... what else can I say... the head of the table is simply ridiculous.... who chose the head of the clan.... well, it's not at all... Marquis Vincent? It doesn't play at all .... it would be better if they did a comedy .. The only phrase was something like ""I am a Note"")) Keanu is a pity, they made it some kind of Looser in the film ... constantly snatches .... constantly substituted .... and they don't take bullets ... and an endless magazine of cartridges .... and a sword fight against guns at the very beginning is generally trash .... spoiled the film with endless slaughter .... the first and second films were a top but the 4th is like a game where you need to wet everyone ... about nothing at all ...",2
Guy_O,"This latest instalment in the John Wick saga has everything you have come to expect from this title ... but there's a problem ... it's way way way too much of the same. The fight scenes and action sequences were great as always, and at times the cinematography went to a new heights of movie making (both metaphorically and literally!).

But then as the old saying goes ... too much of a good thing spoils it. And that's exactly what went wrong with this movie. The fight scenes just ran on forever, way too long, and at times when the action should have come to it's natural conclusion, the whole fight sequence would repeat itself ... and over again! It all became so tiresome, very disappointing.

This movie could have easily been an hour shorter in run time than it was (it's nearly 3 hours long as it is) and it would have been far more enjoyable.

The original cast of actors are now starting to show their age, and the new characters are shallow and thin in development.

This franchise could have easily ended here with this movie as the final instalment. It completes the John Wick story perfectly, it comes to a satisfying conclusion with all the loose ends resolved nicely. So to 'resurrect' this character for Chapter 5 will be just a greedy money making venture with no other intent than to milk cash from the pockets of the cult following masses.

I, for one, will not be going back for Chapter 5. It should be left to lie peacefully in the grave where it belongs.",6
craigape-161-462968,"If you didn't like the last three, you won't like this one, but if you liked them at all, you'll love this one. This movie doubles down on everything that made the previous movies great. I have minor gripes here or there, but this movie is an absolute treat we didn't do anything to deserve, and I very much look forward to seeing it again already. Soundtrack was great, fight scenes were great, the variety of environments and interpretations of combat were great (and far better than some of the previous). This movie is a work of art in what is otherwise an ocean of Hollywood garbage.

For those of you who are interested, the references to classic literature (Dante's Inferno in particular) are scattered throughout as in previous movies and add some extra mythos and symbolism to most of what you're seeing, if you can pick it out.",10
nathanhcwatson,"The 4th instalment of John Wick takes it up a notch with some of the best fight choreography I've ever seen. With a noticeably larger budget you can tell Stahelski was allowed to have some fun behind the camera.

The storyline is utterly brutal and unrelenting, and never a dull moment with hints of visual comedy sprinkled throughout. A few chuckles in the cinema in this otherwise intense film.

As mentioned before, the choreography is utterly impressive, thinking about the amount of time rehearsals took is scary. The sheer professionalism and perfectionism is unparalleled with anything I have ever seen before.

It is truly the best ending to a beloved franchise and without a doubt the best 4th film in a series.",10
kamzrevs,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best movie in the franchise and one of greatest action movies ever made period!!!!! Characters are great especially Donnie Yen's Caine, he stole the whole fu$$ing movie - his acting and fight scenes are just masterpiece, this is Donnie's best Hollywood movie yet. Scott Adkins' Killa was also amazing, even in fatsuit he was fighting like a with out it and his fighting style reminded me of the legendary Sammo Hung in SPL: Killzone (2005), Bill Skarsgard played propably the best villian of all JW films. Action Sequences were insane, amazing, epic, incredible, jaw-dropping.",10
johndavidson-1,"An evening at a local independent cinema to see a movie is rarely wasted.

John Wick 4 is a bit silly, but then again so were Chapters 3 and 2.. The familiar faces of Ian McShane (replete with the 2nd worst false teeth in the movie) and Laurence Fishbourne as well as Donnie Yen , Hiroyuki Sanada and the late lamented Lance Reddick all turn up for the mayhem.

With Bill Skaarsgard playing the villainous Marquis you have someone specific to root against.

It's enjoyable hokum, though most of the set piece fight scenes do go on for longer than they need to, but fortunately there are enough character beats between the bullets, knives and swords to actually make you care just a little about who wins.",7
alicsc,"I went to check out the 4th installment of the John Wick installments with my family. Prior to watching the movie, i have read many positive reviews and went in expecting to be amazed! I have to say the movie surpassed all my expectations and completely blew me away with it's awesomeness and record breaking quality of action! Any upcoming movie in this genre will have to benchmark against this epic movie, as in my opinion, it is the best action movie i've ever seen! This movie is worthy of an Oscar and should be recognized for what it has produced to the audience! Well done to the cast!! Outstanding performances and I do hope they come back with a 5th installment and keep it going!",10
damir-vujevic,"I know these movies are action movies, and action they have, great action. But sometimes it is also about balancing all the other stuff with that action.

World building is not a bad thing if you do it properly. Lots of characters are really good, and needed a little bit more screen time or at least a sip more of backstory. It doesn't move focus from the main character if you do it the right way.

Action scenes are as always great, but too much is too much, pointless violence against totally unimportant characters on one had and then we get no ""big bad"" or the real ""mission accomplished"" feel at the end.

The Warriors throwbacks were a nice thing, also, with spaghetti western touches.

Also, we already have a ""Nobody"", this guy should've been named ""No one"" or something like that.

All in all, I like these movies, this one is good (7 good) but this one could've been better, just an opinion.",7
jeffberlant,"Go to the bathroom before the movie because if you leave during you ""will"" miss something for sure.. Its John Wick on Steroids!!! And when you think you know what's happening next(other than another few hundred deaths) it takes a turn, again and again. Lots of stories inside the main story. Keanu is well great. And all the characters are there along with the whole host of new characters that spice up the stories, inside the story. There are some chuckles when you need them the most so you can exhale and take a fresh breath scattered throughout the film. Oh yea stay until the end of the credits!! Enjoy.",10
adibshahriar,Action all kinds of actions possible. It was preetyyy good as a great action movie. Although felt kind of repetitive with the third part but didn't bore me and they managed to give a very decent ending which I didn't expect. The best part about this movie for me apart the mind blowing endless action set pieces is that it develops John Wick into a great protagonist. During the middle part of this movie I was actually questioning the reason behind John wicks struggle but in the end they gave him a well deserved ending. The background music was amazing also fight choreography. It was a brave desicion not to shoot any of these fights in pitch black darkness and it payed off. One of the best action films ever.,7
BMWAudiMerc,"Was really surprised that this film still holds my attention even though its already the fourth installment. Not sure if its Keanu or Donnie Yen but both was great especially in the action scenes ! The use of every weapon available is what made me think of those old HK action movie that I cannot even find anymore now. Overall, the storyline is engaging even if its the 4th one , the actions are fast & furious and a highlight for me & the actors carried out their roles very well.. Keanu is excellent as always, Donnie as well. I am also quite taken with Rina Sawayama as Akira. In my opinion : this is so much better than any of the Marvel series.",8
mvanek-48586,"Dude I just saw this film last night and it was absolutely phenomenal. The fight scenes were so cool especially the shotgun dragons breath scene where the camera is looking down into the building and follows Wick from above as he lays waste lol. It was a little bit dragged out though. I liked it don't get me Wrong but I think it would've worked completely fine had it be 2hrs30mins in runtime. Some of the fight scenes give you a beat to relax then start back up. The whole Osaka Continental fight scene was so cool with the arrows. Donnie Yen is a beast too. Especially in the Osaka scene. My only gripe with the film, which I understand at Keanus age and stunts can be taxing, is him phoning in his performance. Even with the first Wick film he was more animated. Especially in his movies before then. Like look at the first matrix even and then put his performance here aside it. You'll see he had more emotion back then. Yeah you can say it's ""the character"" but even with the latest Bill and Ted as well as Matrix 4, he seemed to be phoning them in as well. So idk but regardless I would see this movie in theaters. IMAX would be best.",9
jay_doddzy,"The John wick saga has found a way to entertain while keeping things simple. The story line to date isn't overly engaging or riveting and that is why they're great and thats why they work. John wick has found a way to offer the action film fan, endless gore and viloance without some BS effort to be overly clever. The 4th instalment offers more of the same, but bigger and better. It can be cringy in parts but who really cares, the amazing fight scenes more than make up for it. I think if you loved the first films you will also love this one. Not sure what's in store for the future of John Wick.....as I've said already, hopefully more of the same.",8
mpic-81374,"Those 3 movies were crafted together to create the 3 hour schemozzle that is John Wick 4. This is what happens when new blood inherits a simple but wildly popular character.

Over-compensation when out of ideas. Let's bring in so many characters we can't keep up with them & bamboozle the optics with the visual delights of vogue cities; Paris, NY & Tokyo.. This movie betrays everything that was right with the first movie.

The fight scenes are straight from a 1986 arcade machine with bad guys lined up patiently to take on our hero & he levels up through every robotic stoush.

The Warriors DJ was my breaking point. My 4th grade self would've loved this crap. Keanu's better than this.",3
casperGhosty,"This movie had some great action, and was Keanu's best performance among the John Wick movies. Pretty much everything that happened between fight scenes was boring dialog that dragged out way too long, to support a plot that was as uninspired as the other JW movies. Many of the fight scenes, although cool, were also dragged out too long. There were several times where the fights were poorly choreographed compared to the previous movies, and it was obvious that his opponent was waiting for him to finish what he was doing.

Overall, this movie provided some enjoyable action moments, and long periods of wonderful naptime. An hour too long. Could be (much) worse.",7
Aayush_Shah,"This really is a 4th chapter. 4x action, 4x dialogues, 4x visuals and stunts are literally amazing.

I wanted a bit more ""involved"" story. It is simple continuation of the last chapter but some ""tweaks"" needed. Yes, the last scene will shock you for sure but without it you will need to want more.

Yes of course, whatever shown in the first 3 episodes are summarised and when John is dying in the last scene that won't make you cry but will make you want him more and a sence of relief that he is now free from all the BS he faced.

So overall it is a good movie, I would love it more if the fighting scenes were taken in a different way than they did in the last 3 chapters. Some new angles, slow and closeup scenes etc will make it a lit.",7
aenix,"I'm not gonna write much.

If you like the concept of the John Wick world and previous movies with it's Action then this is a must watch.

This part isn't the best story-wise but the action and the way they used the lighting and camera in the fighting-scenes is just phenomenal.

Also the action sequences last for a long time as soon as it starts with extremely well choreographed fights.

Its more about the details like fights in the background while the main event is in the foreground.

There is so much going on that i can just say its a clear 9/10 if you don't expect Interstellar-like story.

You just fly though this 3hours. But i also think its more meant for cinema than TV.",9
nihlus-50873,"Some really good action scenes can't overcome the hurdles of overconcoluted lore and a story which a 5 year old would write.

The fist movie worked in its simplicity with impactful action, you could nearly feel the punches watching it. By the fourth movie its just an unwanted parody of itself.

Where you can't help yourself but laugh at the ridiculous scenes, which seem to be in there for the rule of cool - for me it didn't work. The stakes are just gone if seemingly fall damage is disabled for the main character for the hundredth time or you can see the random mob encounters in the background just waiting until its there time to get shot.",5

It wasn't lovely nor pathetic compared to other characters Last scenes were great gave a new feeling to the whole franchise Length of movie was good, I think it could have been longer The best thing about it is speed of action scenes and fight scenes, fast and fluent Wich brought this style to another level Altogether this movie had it all.",8
saimanikumarsai,"After watching this masterpiece the thing I realised is it's not only Keanu Reeves it's all about stunts cinematography technical department at everything level beast. The whole franchise was never before ever after series.

Well they saying it's lengthy is it I don't think so. A well written directed masterpiece. Movie of the year. If you don't watch this in theatre later u realise how can I miss this so do yourself a favour watch this.

"" They call him BABA YAGA "" for a reason you truly deserve this man Keanu Reeves at his age doing like this stunts is insane. The stunts action sequences are very real.",9
dlxmarshall,"For those saying this is too over the top, repetitive of earlier instalments, lacking in dialogue as opposed to action scenes, I think (respectfully)they are missing the point. This is a fantastic homage to the previous movies (and a nod occasionally to other Keanu movies here and there if you look hard enough). It takes the best of what has gone before and deliberately amplifies it and mythicises it. What other way would be more fitting to end the series? It is not trying to be goodfellas, the Godfather, Cala Blanca, it is trying to end one of the most entertaining and refreshing franchises in recent times with a bang not a whimper and in my view does so admirably. It is not for everyone, but for those that enjoyed the first, it is a fun version of the first movies on amphetamines (or should I say, Speed?).",9
santamonicafan,"Look, let's just put all our cards on the (high) table. Yes, John Wick: Chapter 4 is 169 minutes long. Any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. This thing ain't a ""chapter."" It's a whole damn book - a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium of all manners of asskickery.

Full review at ScreenCrush. (And after you see the movie, here's my interview with Chad Stahelski that's JUST about the stairwell scene that I am sure will go down in history as one of the all-time great moments in action cinema.)

ppppmaas,"After 3 chapters of countless casualties I must admit I had not expected anything quite like this. I wanted to see it and I can tell you I came out very surprised and glad I could see it in the theatre. I was most impressed by the locations, visually very impressive settings and a brilliant cast that is not to be underestimated. It was long but well worth it and I personally enjoyed the first half more than the second. There is a strange presence of humanity, respect and even friendship in this movie once you look past the body count. At some point the action becomes a bit much but the movie as a whole is really in a league of it's own and worthy of a great compliment to all involved!",10
tammytkspr-31282,"I wanted to love it, but I can't. The action was getting tedious after a while and the last 45 minutes I was getting bored. Nothing was really going on and the plot development wasn't there.

Now, it's fun to go escape for nearly 3 hours, but I highly doubt this is going to hold up with repeat viewings. And like I said, the other 3 were far more superior than this, since there seemed to be an actual plot.

Now the pros. The cinematography was top notch, and Connie Yen stole the show and this movie will make him into a mega star. His character, (a blind assassin) is so much fun, I can see them doing a spin off on him and it could work if done right.

But this movie could have cut about 30 to 45 minutes. And there were some scenes, like John Wick falling off unbelievable heights and getting up unscathed that took me out. There is just no way that is possible and really took me out of suspending my belief. The movie was cartoonish at times and I felt I was watching Loony Toons with some of the stunts.

So, basically, the movie is a fun popcorn flick, but because it has no whit, no humor and can get tedious from time to time, I can only give it 6 stars. Next time, put some things in there to stimulate our brains.",6
lucjameshale,The second half alone is worth the price of admission. What's great about this story is how much the characters appeal John wick is figuring out the world along with the consequences of being into a story. He knows his end is something. But this film deserves multiply viewings and I hope it breaks as many box office records before digital release. Because it just works really well on a massive screen. So far it's both well made and has massive box office growth with how well the story and characters connect with the audience. It's a really beautiful story. I hope liongate knows what they have.,10

John wick chapter 4, is a masterpiece from beginning of the film to end and to post credit scene.

On a personal level i may not be a fan of the ending of the film, but i was prepared for that kind of ending of this movie.

I Would like to see Mr. Wick alive in the next part.

rfc-19739,"Right away, one thing I have said about the Wick movies is for whatever reason you can check you brain at the door. Not sure why but like other good action films to give it a pass on so many of the glaring weakness or far fetched things in the movie. But that is why they can be fun. Wick is basically a super hero without the fancy suits , well I guess one fancy suit, or magical abilities. I wonder what the official count is for the hit rate for bullets flying at him. I think is must be like a 0.1% hit rate. Maybe this is a prequel to star wars and all of the gunmen grow up to be storm troopers. Not to mention how many cars hit him. One weakness was the villain, most villains don't subcontract their work as much as he did but what do I know, maybe they do. All in all not a bad watch.",8
Ezzeldien2121,"A good conclusion to this movie series.. I think, I was very attached to the character of John Wick, but I think that no movie in the series has so far surpassed the first movie, which combined action and drama, but the action later.. especially in this chapter did not succeed in this formula, as it was a very long film, it bored me many times.

And after I sympathized with John Wick as a strong or even superhuman in the beginning, from the second chapter to this chapter, I interacted with him as if he was a robot.

Yes, the action is very good, but the long fighting scenes did not present anything new, and their repetition did not make them the climax of the events, but rather a regular thing, as the fighting scene was repeated among dancers and among street cars... without any reaction, so that I could almost swear that the NPCs in GTA games will react better.

This does not mean that I hated the movie, but if I miss the character of John Wick, I will always go to watch the first part, which is the part that I will recommend to others with enthusiasm.",5
Falcon_fury,"John Wick 4 is the latest installment of the popular action franchise starring Keanu Reeves as the unstoppable assassin. The movie follows Wick as he tries to clear his name and defeat a new enemy, Marquis, who has taken over the High Table, the organization that rules the underworld. Along the way, Wick faces old friends and foes, travels across the globe, and engages in spectacular fight scenes.

The movie is a feast for action fans, as it delivers some of the most impressive and inventive action sequences ever seen on screen. The choreography, cinematography, and sound design are all top-notch, creating a visceral and thrilling experience. Keanu Reeves is charismatic and convincing as Wick, showing both his physical prowess and his emotional vulnerability. The supporting cast is also excellent, with Donnie Yen, Laurence Fishburne, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Bill Skarsgard among the standouts.

However, the movie is not without its flaws. The plot is thin and convoluted, relying on a lot of exposition and contrivances to move the story forward. The movie also suffers from being too long and overstuffed, as it tries to cram in too many characters, locations, and subplots. Some of the scenes drag on for too long, losing their impact and excitement. The movie also lacks a sense of finality, as it sets up potential spin-offs and sequels instead of giving a satisfying conclusion.

Overall, John Wick 4 is a highly entertaining action film that showcases Keanu Reeves' star power and skill. It is not a perfect film, but it is a fun and exhilarating ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you are a fan of the franchise or of action movies in general, you will enjoy John Wick 4.",9
auditorgeek,"After the semi letdown of JW3 I was so happy that 4 made up and more. This was my favorite of the franchise. It had everything that you would expect from this movie. The fight scenes, gun scenes, choreography, music.... great soundtrack!! All were perfectly chosen. There were a few scenes where I felt the music could have been much louder. It was an odd choice and I'll crank it way up at home. They brought in some new characters ... likeable characters. I could see a spin-off with nobody. Something else with a couple others that had some loose ends that were not neatly completed.

John wick 4 really tied things together well and had a great moral to the story. It showed that our actions have consequences. Watch it on the big screen and enjoy some time with sn old friend.",10
mabmadridespana,"A blind man, a homeless guy, and John Wick enter a German club and... No, it's not a joke, it is the wildest action movie of this century.

We would not be honest if we denied the fact that, over all things, this saga is sheer entertainment, powerful visuals of martial arts and gun fu, bigger than life destruction, a non stop pace, and a really thrilling concept of spectacle based on the point of ""more is more"". For if this alone wouldn't be enough, we have stunning suspense and the feel of enormous authority and strength of the French Marquis, and also the deeply emotional and satisfactory dramatic work of Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen.

What else can I say? Simply WOW, since I have felt definitely blown away by the bird-eye shot in the building with infinite grenade shooting. But... what is infinite? If you are wondering about it, I only have to say: stairs, lots of stairs.

The final duel at the sunrise is just deeply satisfying and leaves me thinking we need another fight with Keanu. Let's hope for this to be only a temporal game over, and maybe we can see Mr. Wick down those stairs triumphant.

I won't stop him until I see him in Turkey fighting Kenan Imirzalioglu.",10
dylanwasunfortunatelytaken,"Wow, that was something. John Wick: Chapter 4 exceeds at what makes this franchise so sensational. Action scene after action scene, with plenty of gore mixed with a (surprisingly) good story.

Despite the long runtime this is Mr. Wick's grandest film, in a near perfect action tetralogy, with an ending that perfectly fits the film. Sad, yet necessary, and the execution is next to flawless.

The only thing that could ruin this is a fifth installment. Come on, Hollywood I'm praying you don't try to make some easy money on an unnecessary film.

My only recommendation to you is to watch this film before it leaves theaters. You won't regret it, I promise.",8
highdefinitionsound,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is an action-packed thriller that will certainly please fans of the franchise. The film delivers some impressive fight scenes and great cinematography that is characteristic of the John Wick films. Keanu Reeves once again delivers a solid performance as the titular character, showcasing his impressive martial arts skills and stoic demeanor.

However, the film does feel a bit repetitive in terms of its plot and action sequences. While the action is well-executed, it doesn't bring much that we haven't seen before in the previous films. Additionally, some of the new characters introduced in the film could have been developed more fully.

Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is an enjoyable continuation of the franchise, with some standout moments that will satisfy fans, but it lacks the freshness and excitement of the earlier films. The film earns a 7/10 rating for its strong action, solid performances, and impressive production values.",8
cosmicfish,"The violence is so cartoonish. The man falls 4 stories onto a van, hard enough to dent it in 2 feet. Barely an issue. Every goon can take 3 headshots and keep fighting. The blind guy is an amazing marksman. The other guy uses a shotgun like a sniper rifle. The fat head honcho is an unstoppable tank.

The whole plot revolves around deception and finesse and the big ending is him tricking a guy. Talk about veering away from character!

And it's all for what, exactly?

He could have been the High Table's boogeyman. The one that makes them play fair with their underlings. Kill the ones too stupid to fear death until the ones remaining realize it isn't worth it. Instead he changes... nothing. Except for seeing his friends die.

What a waste.",N/A
Aman_Goyal,"* Is this one of the best action films? - Absolutely!

*Is this the best Martial Arts film? - YES! In Hollywood!

*Is this the best solely action film of Keanu Reeves? Perhaps! I like Speed (1994) much more than everything else.**

*Direction: It's exquisite and surely an improvement over previous installments. There's more room for long continuous fight scenes and the car sequences are awesome too! The whole top angle fight sequence was so much fun to watch, and if you want more of that, go watch Brain De Palma's SNAKE EYES (1998).

> At 169 minutes, it's surely over-long by at least 20 minutes.

*Plot: The story is engaging but doesn't elevate itself with multiple twists and turns, much like the previous installments. The villain is somewhat dumb and we always know what'sgoing to happen next, even if we don't know how it's going to happen.

> Plus point is it keeps getting better and the ending my even be the best part of the entire thing.

*Cast: **Donnie Yen as Caine, the blind High Table assassin is the only fresh breath in the film making it entertaining, exquisite and emotional.

**Bill Skarsg√•rd as the Marquis acts fine and dresses and better although the script doesn't allow him to be as sharp as literally any other character.

**Rina Sawayama as Akira has so much potential for possible future projects, but here she seems to have been nowhere near utilised.

**Reeves is of course the back bone of the film, giving his Career Best Performance!

* Costume design: In my opinion, the best part of the film. Especially that of Marquis, putting a richness to the whole thing.

* Cinematography: Almost every frame is breathtaking and justifies being set in night. Paris looks as beautiful as it did in classic Audrey Hepburn films (Charades (1963). Like the first 3 chapters had colours GREEN, BLUE & RESPECTIVELY, the YELLOW shines here. The stairs, the sunrise, the traffic, all are pleasing to eyes.

* Ending: >The ending could be interpreted in multiple ways, such as (SPOILERS) John died like said, or didn't and yet faked his death and went somewhere to avoid the underworld life and all the bounty hunters (like in Sherlock Holmes, where he is seen at his own grave).

>Though some are calling it the best part of the franchise thus far, I'll still place it second following Chapter 2.

>P. S. no offense to John Wick, but this film shows him a whole lot more invincible than even he is supposed to be capable of. Surviving multiple bullets is one thing, but falling from high story buildings onto metallic vehicles, and falling 200 steps? As a good film, this one deserves to have been somewhat more grounded or logical.

* Overall: > My rating: 7.6/10 > Rotten Tomatoes: 95% Fresh, 8.2/10 avg rating > Metacritic: 78.",8
liquidgfx,"By making this film a 3 hour monster they removed most of the urgency that was felt in the earlier films. The action is stunning but the majority of it goes on for longer than it needs to and can occasionally get boring. Also, I know that he's supposed to be unstoppable but some of the scenes stretch those limits WAY too far (all I will say is ""stairs"").

I will say that when the camera goes to the over the top view it changed from good to outstanding, but this unfortunately was short lived and ended with another stretch of the limits previously mentioned.

Hoping to see more urgency and maybe a little more originality return in the inevitable John Wick: Chapter 5!",6
retroracer48,"This movie was the best movie in the John wick franchise and even the best action movie of all time. Try naming another one that is better then this movie because you will have a hard time trying to. Watched it in IMAX and oh my god it was amazing. The way the songs were with the action and how it sounded was incredible. Every single fight scene took my breath away and I can't remember a time where my jaw was not dropped. I am so happy that the hype that came with the film payed off. If you have not seen this movie yet go to your car and watch it because it is definitely worth your time.

10/10 Watch it NOW.",10
Rjbulger115,"It had a decent story for john wick with lots of action. It seemed like it tried to combine all the action of the first 3 into this movie. Some interesting characters- the blind ninja fighter and the wannabe bad guy, it was good to see Clancy Brown in this movie. Some fight scenes were really good. Some may have went too long yet Decent overall. The music and background music wasnt as good as the first 3- some of the fight music sounded like it was taken right from The other john wicks. They Definitely gave it a more of a New York feel with the classic new york movie they paid homage to in this movie.",6
hutch2001,"Above and beyond the action one expects when watching a John Wick film. Don't take the film too seriously/realistically!

Great acting (other than Keanu! ;):
The characters of Marquis and Winston, just to name a couple, are charismatic and intriguing throughout.


Amazing stylised settings and world building:
The world of John Wick is developed even further - and its eerie, super-elite nature is fitting.


Vibrant soundtrack to accompany.



I personally felt the fight scenes sometimes dragged on (just a bit) but action and John Wick movies are synonymous - so this isn't a major criticism!",7
tiffanyswift-01525,"I watched it without watching the three prequels, I have to say I'm very impressed by the gripping and tense action ,as well as top notch cinematography,just amazing. But unstopping sequences of fun fighting (which are truly compact and leave you no chance to take a breathe, I'm quite tired. For reason that you know the protagonist would survive all those gruelling attacks and walk towards the final duel scene. When the first hour you get to see the exotic, cyberpunk and elegant touch of Japan,then it takes you to Berlin and the city of light. It's all about life and death,but also a complicated relationship between the old friends which involves trust and repay. A good film in total,worth the watch.",8
mikedud-81751,"When the first John Wick movie came out, it revitalized the action movie genre. Nearly 10 years later, and two sequels in, we get arguably the best installment of the franchise. John Wick: Chapter 4 ups the ante on absolutely everything. From stunning set pieces, to non-stop high voltage action sequences.

Keanu Reeves once again is breathtaking in the role of the legendary hitman. He is a true inspiration, proving that age is just a number. The guy is in his 50's and is pulling off amazing choreographed action sequences. The action sequences are incredible. Utilizing the setting around them, from Morocco to Japan to France, which subsequently makes every scene unique and a stand out. Nothing feels out of place or boring, each scene has prominence and substance to them.

John Wicks war against The High Table brings him into conflict with some interesting new adversaries. Bill Skarsgards villainous role as one of the heads of The High Table is menacing, cold and calculating. He pulls the strings of the plot all the way to the end. Donnie Yen yet again plays another blind badass character. This time a hitman who has history with Wick, and a motive that forces him into hunting Wick down. A very cool and compelling character that I hope to see more of later on.

The two hour and forty minute runtime went by like a breeze, captivating from the very beginning to the somber bittersweet ending. A satisfying conclusion to John Wicks story, as he was finally at peace with everything and returned home to his wife. I hope his story stays concluded, even though nowadays it seems like no one truly stays dead.

In light of the conclusion I can honestly conclude that John Wick: Chapter 4 is one of the greatest action movies of all time. Subsequently, the franchise will go down in history as one of the greats, as the bar for action movies reaches a new standard.",10
lenorcardenas,"Best John Wick movie so far. This is a rollercoaster ride that doesn't end. Great acting, amazing scenery and non stop action. The cinematography is masterful. Which is something you don't usually get from an action film. This movie is a work of art in so many ways. From the shooting to the hand to hand combat to the swordsmanship. You are kept engage the entire time, and the story is there as well. Great cast, some familiar faces, some new. They all do an amazing job. By end of the movie, I didn't think I could be anymore entertained, but I was. I walked out of the theatre in awe of this film. Beautifully done.",10
hyderalw,"Typical story but not so typical dialogue, action sequences, action choreography, The music at the right time, incredible acting, incredible Rythm and pace of the movie and hands down a Legend of a film.

The movie is about 3 hours long and the first 15 minutes maybe too much to digest as there is alot happening in the first 15 minutes but once the story sets in right after 15-16 minutes then you know exactly what is about to happen and what your going to get but in what way will keep you intrigued and exited all the way through, believe me the 3 hours will feel like 1 hour.

Lastly John Wick 4 is filled with action sequences that are so sharply timed it will make you stand up or even make you move in your chair, exhilarating to say the least; This is not just a Guy movie, this is a legend of a movie that needs to be viewed by everyone above 15 years of age.

I took one star away coz i wish there was some more Lawrence Fishburne :(",9
hvozdikmilan,"After seeing Chapter 4 for the fist time while just vaguely remembering plot of each previous movie I watched just once at the time they came out I didn't know what to think about it. Action, cinematography, stunt work and characters were all great, but I just didn't get the movie.

So I decided watch every John Wick back to back and see Chapter 4 again. And I must say, those movies really are one story told in four chapters (so far). They continue where previous left and build on each other really nicely.

And Chapter 4 is the biggest, boldest and the most beautiful of them all. I get the movie now and I think that it's brilliant, especially the final part. There is one location that feels bit weaker than the others, but I won't be lowering the score for that.",10
matthewcojeen,"Where do I start, its got it all, u think your watch action, western vibe. Cinematography is so good, scene stunning, story line do very well. KR plays JW very well indeed all that training pays of with all the action scene, it reminds of better tomorrow film, its got 2 action legend support cast, a dog who u fall in love with. It's 2 hrs 40 ish mins but time fly so fast with this stylish dark action thriller, I like the electric light it got that 80's feeling. I need to watch it again there alot to take in, lovejoy back, the bad guy french plays it great, the car chase and fight scene on the roundabout is a different level. So people don't walk run to watch JWC4.",9
firelover-43847,This movie has broken all expectations I thought I would come in happy and come out still happy but that wasn't reality I came in happy and came out tears rolling down my face bear in mind I haven't seen any of the other movies aside from 3 and I can see the great improvement from 3 to 4. Literally this movie has set a new high for all action movies from now on like all movies there is still pros and cons some cons are the fact that... well nothing the whole movie was one continuous pro there was not one bad thing a part from the fact that in the night club scene where he gets the gold tooth it was a problem for me and many others that no one reacted during the fights like?? All in all 10/10 best ending of all time. Would rate this a 1000/10 if I could.,10
gcplassmeyer,"Action, dicey villains and finally the demise of our beloved John Wick. We all go to these movies because we know what to expect and we embrace it. Couple that with the incomparable and once in a life time human in Keanu Reeves it can do no wrong!

Yes the plot lacked some substance and yes there were some cheesy scenes that can make you cringe a bit. NONE OF THAT MATTERS! Enjoy it for what it is and those flaws are very easily overlooked.

If you followed the John Wick story from beginning to end you know it is hands down one of the greatest set of action moves ever made.

Well done John Wick, you will be missed.",10
raimy_dog,"This is simply not just the best John Wick movie but one of the best action movies I have ever seen without exagerating, brutal, unique fighting scenes and epic cinematography overall. The movie had a runtime of 169 minutes and I just did not want it to end at all, although you think that you know what might happen next but it always kind of surprises you.

The fighting scenes and the coreography is just a pure joy to watch, such a talented cast, even the guys who were 'taking a beating' .

It nicely continues the story from where chapter 3 left off and ends with somewhat of an open ending in my opinion, adding new interesting characters, each unique to their own. Just marvelous!",10
TurboTerminator,"I am a big fan of the series and loved the first three movies, so I watched it during release weekend.

It is longer than the first three movies and is nearly 3 hours long, but you will be fully engaged with the movie and won't feel that it is long.

They took the action sequences to the next level and set the bar for action movies. Probably no other Hollywood movie in recent memory has come up so many original action sequences.

People who watched the earlier movies should definitely go see this one and you will not be disappointed.

They made Wick look a bit more human in this one than the larger than life figure as he was depicted in the earlier movies. After 4 great movies this is a fitting end to the Wick saga.",8
jimmymiller-19656,"For years during action movies I've just wanted more action i.e. The transformers franchise and many others. John Wick 4 takes action movies to a whole new level. This movie is 3/4 action and its some of the best fighting and visuals I've ever witnessed in any movie. While a lot of it will have you saying to yourself, ""there's no way he survives this"", you quickly will remember that's part of the lore of the John Wick movies and you don't care anymore. Very solid movie and a hell of a way to end the franchise if they so choose (Hope they don't). My only dislike is the main enemy of this movie didn't get the violent and punishing death that he deserved, however it was satisfying when he did eat that bullet.",9
peterspam-22486,"A shame they had to make this 4th part, as it really has nothing to offer compared to the first three.

Sure, John Wick was always about the action, but this part had nothing new to show for: most of the time feels like watching a jiu-jitsu dojo where he wraps his feet around someone's head just to shoot him in the head with a gun. In the first three movies this was not done too many times to make it repetitive but in the fourth movie it's just a filler.

You know you're bored when exactly the same action scene of part 1 or 2 that had me hooked now makes me fall asleep. And when watching a dog attack a bad guy is more fun than watching our hero being badass.

Occasionally there are dialogues with the good actors that keep the franchise alive, but other than that I have already forgotten what this was all about.

If you want to watch some mindless fun, by all means, but this one gets boring quick.",6
timpaelfsborg,"This franchise is the first franchise EVER!! To get better with every sequel. I loved ""John Wick"" thought it was a decent action/martial arts movie... then came the second movie. Finally, something that dares stand out in the actionscene since the matrix, but chad wasn't happy there! He knew Keanu had some more fights in him, therefore he made chapter three. Chapter three was epic, legendary, awestrucking, I loved every minute. But stahelski wasn't done there, he amps both the lore, story and the action. John wick chapter 4 is the best sequel to a franchise I've ever seen(if you like action/martial arts). Matrix fans like me will at very least enjoy it!",9
quocthong-11089,"Unlike the previous three chapters, this is the worst chapter in the John Wick franchise. For more than 3 hours, John Wick was like a superhero who killed everyone without any difficulty. This movie reminds me of the 70s 80s with the Terminator, Rambo,... when the main character was simply ""unstoppable"". Besides, John Wick doesn't seem to understand the danger to himself. He rushed out and shot and killed as if to prove that he was just a ""killer"". Then the blind character played by Donnie Yen is also like a superhero when he can walk freely, use swords, shoot people with guns as if his eyes are still bright??? I couldn't understand the plot throughout the length of the movie. This is definitely the most wasted 3 hours of my life.",1
theryuary,"This is one of the craziest actions movies I've seen since Fury Road. This had all the creativity and diversity you would expect from a John Wick movie plus a little more. The stunt team is still working hard to bring set-pieces and direction that have never been seen before and for that reason alone it's worth a viewing. A word of warning, however, myself and some others have complaints about the audio being too loud at time. Leaving the theatre afterwards, I still had the sound of the gunshots lingering in my ears. On paper, there is nothing about this movie that does not meet expectations. However, by watching this movie I've learned how much the emotional stakes of the first movie were important. John Wick's character is heavy minimized compared to previous movies and the change, for me, was hard to get over. At this point in the franchise I need to stakes to be higher than ever, but the story comes across as a little directionless and it's not quite clear what John is fighting for anymore. The movie introduces new side characters and gives them depth and driving factors which makes the audience route for them, while simultaneously pointing out the lack of motivation John has to even live. At the end of this three hour movie I'm not sure what changed for the characters involved and that's a pretty big problem for a movie to have. Overall, it's a lot of fun but lacking the substance I need from the main characters.",7
ebinbt-09429,"John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers a thrilling and immersive experience that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. Despite being the fourth movie in the franchise, it's clear that the filmmakers haven't run out of tricks, and the result is a movie that is as fresh and exciting as the first.

Keanu Reeves' portrayal of the world-weary assassin is masterful, with his weariness and struggles palpable throughout the film. The high stakes and increased death count make the character's journey even more intense, and Reeves rises to the challenge with ease.

The action sequences in John Wick: Chapter 4 are nothing short of spectacular. Each set piece is magnificently choreographed and shot, with a clear homage to classic martial-arts genres and Hollywood Westerns. The movie also manages to top everything that's come before in the franchise, with new and creative ways to keep the audience engaged.

It's also worth mentioning that the film is an absolute joy to watch in IMAX, with the immersive experience making the action sequences all the more thrilling.

While the weight of trying to top everything that's come before is not lost on the filmmakers, they rise to the challenge with elegance and creativity, delivering a movie that is both a homage to the classic action genre and a fresh addition to the franchise.

In short, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a killer night out at the movies. With an incredible performance from Keanu Reeves, stunning visuals, and non-stop action, it's a must-watch for fans of the series and anyone looking for an immersive and thrilling cinematic experience.",10
cjordan-72794,"Not the way that I would have wanted to see it end with the death of John Wick, but a fair and realistic ending. A man can only survive so long, but he went out the best way he could have. Usually a trilogy or 'Quadigy' would gradually get worse and more disappointing, but the John Wick films are a testament to a VERY small percentage of modern films still being able to deliver on top. John Wick is more than a movie, it's a film, and I have no way of voting any of them any lower than an 8/10 and I'm a harsh voter when it comes to movies and films.

I think the only reason I didn't vote it any higher is because I honestly could have kept going and seen more John Wick films after this one! But that's just it. Had they kept pushing it to a Chapter 5, or even a 6, you then start running a sensitive risk of the films becoming too tedious or exhausting. I'm just sad to not see any more, but I'm also relieved that they stopped when they did. They stopped when they should have. Thank you for these fantastic films!",8
bartbull-1,"John Wick 4, Fantastic photography, fantastic action scenes. Plot hmm ok but action makes up for that. The bad henchmen have built proof armor in their suit coats very cool idea. If they didn't film would be over in under a hour. Beautiful scenery and colours makes for great eye candy.

One great thing about the fighting sequences there not cut into a thousand different edits. Manly because the actors can really fight!

So many of the fight scenes run a long time without cutting to a different angle which I love.

Most favorite character, Russian Fat Killa. Played by Scott Adkins.

This character is hilarious way he talks and plays cards. You can tell he's in a fat suit, but he sure can fight!

Just amazing actor Scott is, hope he's in more films.

So overall good film, will have to watch again.",9
tylerawalton,"I believe this is tied with John Wick 1 as the best John wick movie. Full of action from start to finish. Awesome kills from John and other characters throughout. Great villains throughout the movie very well written too. The cinematography was great. The pacing was fantastic it managed to keep me engaged throughout the whole film with all of the action in between. The whole movie was very well written and you can tell they really tried to make this the best John wick movie and pulled out all of the stops.

I believe this was a great way to end the John Wick Franchise. May you Rest in Peace John Wick and more importantly Lance Reddick who was taken from us too soon.",10
Poula-Nabil,"So I will start off by the things i really enjoyed like the cinematography for example, the camera work in the fire bullet scene was just out of this world , the utilization of new weapons & techniques and everything is just fresh even after 3 full action packed movies it's still going strong But i have like a teeny tiny problem and a spoiler alert I really have a problem with the "" nobody "" i mean if the "" nobody "" was completely cut from the movie it wouldn't have mattered, the character has no clear motive or at least a very shallow one which is money ? We have no clue what does he need the money for ? Why is he participating and gambling with his own life just for few extra bucks when there is no clear point of why is he so desperate for the money it was never ever shown ! And when he can finally claim his bounty after so so much effort he just backs off like ??? Why why does such character have screen time ? It's just confusing like there is this scene that just breaks the whole logic and mood when his dog gets thrown at a car and just bounces back like okay I thought humans are like super trained tough durable people but even dogs that completely separated me from the experience and the whole "" nobody "" plot is just not satisfying in my humble opinion.",7
danielforan-75610,"Chapter 4 is by far, far the best in the series and the best action movie we've gotten since the matrix in 1999.

The film is a story about freedom for john but poses a interesting question about what john will do if he wins and gets his freedom. Everyone gets a motivation that's understandable and leads them to clash with others often in a fight between them.

Chad stahelski has improved hugely as a director its no longer just cool stunts but now he's really matured as a director he plays to his strengths and the directing is by far one of the best aspects of the movie

The film looks amazing not just the colors but the action pursues onscreen is just jawdropping with people performing these stunts live in front of you and you feel every punch hit kick stab and that's truly a credit to the stunt performers here and the vfx team that helped bring it all together. Now the film is 169 minutes long. However I didn't feel the 3 hours and instead it felt like 1 hour and 40 minutes which is a magical feet of editing and pacing.

The films side charachters have their own storylin eand events. The most memorable is caine played by donnie yen a blind assassin and a old friend of John whose sent by Bill Skargards marquee the highest ranked of the high table to kill john wick and seeing how john has nothing to lose you actually feel sorry for caine as its clear he doesn't want to do what he's been tasked with doing but is aware of what happens if rules are broken and it makes him a very interesting charachter that I would love to have a spin off film with. Other memorable side characters are mr nobody or tracker as he's listed here on imdb (shaming anderson) is a low class assassin whose after john however is on and off between going ahead with what he's set out to do for personal reasons and then we have shimazy (hiroyuki sanada) whose a owner of a continental in Japan and gets a set piece to shine as well as his daughter AKira (Rina sawayama) who blames john for breaking the rules and fears for her fathers safety.

The bowery king (Lawrence fishbourne), winston (Ian mc shane) and charon (lance reddick r.i.p) are all here and have their own reasons for helping john tldr every charachter here is excellent and brought to life in such a way that you forget that they're not real people and just actors playing them this also goes for keanu reeves as john wick he's brilliant here and we all know that he does his own stunts which is really the draw for these movies but this one is amazing in all departments. He'll even the soundtrack is amazing here tyler bates and Joel j Richards score is present in the film and benefits the action on screen and over all film.

The film also gives john a satisfying resolution to his story over the 4 movies.

The only other action movies I'd put above this is die hard and terminator 2 judgement day to even be compared to those movies should scream see this movie if it doesint I don't know what will.

See this in cinemas ideally a imax cinema and don't wait till its on a streaming service this was made to be seen on the biggest screen possible.

So overall, It's a 10/10 movie that you should absolutely see in cinemas if at all possible you won't regret it and is by far the best action film since the matrix in 1999. SEE IT!",10
robertschuiszils,"The original John Wick was a hyperstylised revenge action movie with a wonderfully short runtime, well cast main actor and many strong performances in supporting roles. It felt fresh and new and had a convincing anti-hero with an understandable motivation. It was able to built up the necessary atmosphere of tension and suspense. A truly fun watch.

Over the course of the of three sequels all that is left are stylised fight choreographies mixed with an overubandance of CGI. The general visual style throws any claim to realism over board. There is no more grounding in reality. Berlin and Paris look like comic book versions of real places that aren't inhabited by real people any more. No-one cares about a shooting in a night club or in the middle of parisian traffic at night. This could come across as an interesting artistic choice but there is no purpose to these stylistic decisions other than to make everything seem artificial and detached. On top of all of that, Wick seems almost invincible throughout the movie.

And it makes the action feel impactless besides all the effort that went into the fights and shootouts.

And it makes us care even less for this protagonist that has lost any sense of drive or goal. Why is he still doing what he's doing? Don't know... Should I care? It wouldn't hurt.

This way the viewer gets the impression of watching a three hour demonstration of what modern Hollywood can achieve in terms of action and effects (with the occasional weak cgi background).

John Wick now feels like a franchise movie that pushes on some of the strength of the original but forgets about the things that made us care in the first place. There is nothing new to see, nothing to really care for.

The action has become a special effect without a purpose.",6
horgitom,"I'm gonna be real, I didnt expect much since this is the 4th chapter but I'm not lying when I say that I was just looking forward for this movie to finish. Not only was it way too long, but it was so tiring seeing the same fighting and shoot out scenes again and again at this point it has become way too repetitive.

The first and second movie kind of managed to make the plot armor seem as much as it could be believable but you just don't feel it anymore, its like zombie waves coming towards him every 5 minutes in which he just headtaps them and they never shoot back they literally just walking targets. I get that he is supposed to be the top assassin but it's just way too much. The third chapter already had began losing it a bit but this movie made it ten times worse.

I'm giving this a better rating than it actually deserves cause the cinematography was really impressive and I really respect the actors effort but outside of that it's nothing u haven't seen in the previous movie.",6
smblights,"If you're a fan of the JW franchise than you're fan of the entire franchise and this movie will not disappoint. It does start off a little slower than the last movie as far as the insane action but It's one of the best written JWs yet(at least in my opinion) and the story is partially why the action takes just a hair longer to get to. But not to worry cause the action comes and it comes strong! By now we all know what to expect from the JW movies and if we are watching them, it's because we enjoy what they offer. For me this movie is one of the best written as far as the story goes. I truly enjoyed learn about the parts of the table previously unknown. I'm not sure how I would feel it they ever did these movies without Keanu (as a spin off or something, not even sure I'd give them a chance.) I think when Keanu is done, they should do what a lot of studios don't do and Call It a Success and Say Goodnight! Leave this one be to remain one of the greatest action Series in cinema... Go see it and enjoy.",9
danyessolo,"The scenes left me in awe and I really really loved the story line. John Wick never deceives in all honesty. The actors were good. The main confrontation at the end with his friend was the most excruciating thing to see but more so because he went to help him earlier in order to get to the meeting on time. Great movie and I am happy they decided to kill the main character. I had a wonderful time watching each of them. Keanu understood what the fans were waiting of him. I really loved the vilain's character, his dress code was very elegant, they couldn't have chosen better. The scene of the Anderson fighting with John and then him saving Anderson's dog. WHAT A SCENE! To watch it thinking Lance really died also felt like this is the last thing he did for his legacy.",10
mwprmedia,"I absolutely loved this movie. While Keanu's acting didn't stand out to me, the action sequences from all the other characters were absolutely superb and thrilling to watch. The Asian fighter character was especially cool, and while her acting wasn't my favorite, her action movements were incredible.

I have to say, the choreography and execution of the fights in this movie were some of the best I've seen. The attention to detail and dedication to creating realistic, thrilling fight scenes really shone through.

Overall, I had an amazing time watching this movie and was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. If you're a fan of action movies, I highly recommend giving this one a watch!",8
atulmi,"After back to back giving three successful John wick movie Chad Stahelski back again with Another bang . This time Johnathan kill more bad guy than before. 4th installment give John wick a chance to buy his freedom from high table . OMG Action sequences was Raw ,real, brutal John wick 4 set a standard for upcoming Hollywood movie.

Honestly movie is approx 3 hour long but didn't feel like to that long.

You u get a chance to watch it watch on Big screen. Big screen and intense bgm with maintain grips.

Other characters did good job . Every one love Caine and Mr. Nobody. Honestly give mr. Nobody a spinoff.",10
nicknamerj,"I don't understand the negative reviews. The reviews saying it was boring are laughable. The one thing I will tell you is this movie is far from boring They obviously have not watched any of the Wick movies, This entire franchise takes place in its own little comic book like world. This movie is unbelievable. The villains, the sidekicks, the different characters that come and go are all amazing. The Director of this movie knew exactly what he was doing; with the use of lighting, and visual. The fighting sequences are a feast for the eyes. If you watch this and you say it's boring, then no movie will excite you This is the best one yet !!!",10
dramirez-29694,"From the get go, this entire franchise establishes itself as a perfect representation of the action genre. Similarly, the deeper we dive into the world of international assassins, we find ourselves buried in a brilliantly choreographed and edited action film/series.

Where Bond falls short, Wick exceeds. While many may argue 007's loyalty to a rich story, its no secret the franchise has recently suffered from poor writing and boring plotlines. To further the uphill battle, the traits that made 007 ""James"" in its golden years (much of the misogyny and toxic masculinity) written out we find the 007 franchise struggling to maintain viewership.

An assassin who has mastered the art of killing lets his work speak for itself. His battle IQ is prevalent through the entire series. The thesis for almost every Wick installation is that this mans work speaks for itself. Many high octance action franchises sell their souls to the editing gods and hide poor action sequences with jump cuts and cgi.

Many series lose their funding overtime and over use CGI to hide a majority of their action sequences. John Wick embraces physical combat and elevates it with practical effects.",10
avilon-48406,"The furousty of the fights , the camera work , the cinematography and the speed of events is something never done B4 in any film not even in the other John Wick films.

Keanu Reeves looked tired in the film and exosted from the phyiscal effort of shooting so many realistic marshal art scenes. The gun fights are not realistic but a part of the fantastic fantasy world of the director who yet again managed to surpass his own achievements in the previous chapters.

The chase this time has more variety of characters , hired by the high table to assassin John who is looking to win his freedom again.

This movie must be viewed in a cinema and if you can , Atmos or IMAX. I Watched it at the Superscreen in Leicester Square London.",10
GINNN_D,"If you watched John Wick 1-3, you know what to do. If you enjoyed them, likely you will again. At least that's what I did. I turned on my John Wick mode, watching it as a computer game and not taking it slightly for real, and it was up to the expectations.

The legend continued. The plot managed to get simpler but worked out. The cinematography was impressive. Lots of beautiful scenes from Japan and Paris. The bronzed tone with cooler blue or blushed highlights gave pretty visuals, tuning down and contrasting the brutal fighting sequences (which I did have to close my eyes).

Keanu Reeves is as legendary himself. I have watched many of his movies and he does not fail. To be fair there is not too much acting, but the fighting and all are as good as it gets. I watched Donnie Yen for years, great martial art actor. Yeah he probably had some work done to his face but so what. Bravo to both actors, who are doing great fighting scenes at their age of getting close to 60.

Overall as a John Wick fan, the final chapter gave a satisfactory closure. Nicely done.",9
greendragon-18048,"Am I the only one who thinks John Wick should have ended at number 2? I know his jacket can stop a 9mm bullet but when he is taking numerous point blank shots and they dont even affect him, but the minions in steel plated armor are knocked back 3 ft everytime he shoots them. I love the fights and choreography but he is just a dude in a nice jacket..he isnt a superhero or mutant.

The stunt team is too worried about making the fights bigger and badder than the last movie. The entire first 1/2hr of the movie was nothing but an action scene. Lack of character develpment, introduction or even backstory, left me with a feeling of ""who cares"".

I didnt know who anyone was, didnt feel any connection to them and didnt really care who lived or died.

Watch close during the fights, they arent as awesome as you think. There is one fight where he is fighting two minions in steel armor, and the one actor is standing there doing a bad job of looking hurt and off balance, waiting for John to finish his sequence before the minion jumps in again.

On a final note, this one will definately put me in the alone category, Keanu Reeves may be a beautiful and awesome human being who i would love to spend a day with... but he will never get an academy award, he really isnt a very good actor.",7
vidmiha,"The hype for this movie is on another level...

It seems John Wick gains fall-damage immunity at the end of Chapter 3.

The falls he survives are insane!

Bad guys die instantly from lesser falls in the movie, but John just gets up, shrugs it off, and starts shooting like nothing happened.

Every scene is meticulously made, but it's blurred behind the shower of bullets fired every milisecond.

In a big city scene, the fight is on throughout the city. John is killing bounty hunters, but there are no COPS to be found.

If you like shooting RPGs, you should watch it. Some scenes at the beginning have sloppy hand to hand fights, but they get better during the movie if you don't walk out before the end.",5
labbyguy,"John Wick and John Wick. Chapter 2 were perfect action films with a properly motivated protagonist, incredible action scenes, and sharp editing that kept the pacing tight. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum was a slight letdown plotwise, but still a very good entry that expanded the Wick mythology. That brings us to the wildly overpraised, disappointing Chapter 4. Yes, the action scenes are still jaw-dropping, but there are too many of them and they last for too long. It was the first time I was ever bored in a John Wick movie! Screenwriter Derek Kolstad did not have a hand in writing this one, which may partially explain the silly plot. After all Wick has gone through, it seems he just has to kill a High Table member--put in charge of his termination--in a one-on-one duel to end his troubles. Really? And then when we finally reach the climatic duel, two professional killers can't manage a head shot from a distance of 40 paces? I know...maybe they weren't trying to kill each other. But each one knew that the duel had to result in a death. That's the stinkin' High Table rules! A bigger problem, though, is the almost three-hour running time. It may allow time to introduce more characters, but we don't get to know most of them. Wick's friend Shimazu is introduced and killed off. John's adoptive sister Katia is a promising character, but only has two quick scenes. Charon, one of the best characters in the series, is executed in the first half-hour. Honestly, I hope there is not a John Wick: Chapter 5. I own the first three films and will undoubtedly revisit them in the future. I have no desire to see Chapter 4 again.",6
diverscale299,"I rarely write reviews, but this movie is a complete success. It delivers exactly what I expected, nothing more, and nothing less. I felt like I was back in the 80's, simpler days movie wise. Thank you for the great movie!!!!

As I need to write 600 characters, I'll say that the cast was great, Donnie Yen was a great surprise, I didn't even think I'd see him in there, and I was glad he did his quick punch trick at least once.

It is rare that a trilogy is good (first star wars, indiana jones, aliens to a certain extent...) but to get a quadrilogy all good and not running on fumes at the end is a chef-d'oeuvre by itself.",10
florin_dr,"I gave it 4 stars because of keanu reeves. 8.4 on ImdB, seriously? One of the best films ever made? You gotta be kidding. From the b rated story plot to the dry lines and very little acting there is nothing but the endless fight scenes that keep this going. It starts with some sleek cinematography but becomes an endless bore at which you can't do anything but laugh at some point. I was hoping for one of those great action movies they don't make anymore but maybe I'll have to wait until indiana Jones for that. It may not help that I forgot what the other 3 were about but in all honesty, who cares at this point?",4

user-81-131504,"""You come here thinking there is a way out of this world for you, Mr. Wick. There is not. You are a killer. It's the killing that gives you purpose.""

A film should not have ambitions more than its worth but when the ambitions grow in line with the box office grosses with each installment cascading in stature it must face the consequence of expectations. This is what John Wick as a brand has achieved over the years and Chapter 4 is by far its best gift.

It is a love letter to cinema and filmmaking at large where action, no longer used as a prop, takes centerstage and is celebrated by ballerinas like Keanu Reeves, and Donnie Yen who dignify the space with their own charm and metallic personality. Stunning to say the least. Well choreographed endless string of eye-popping action sequences - 14 in the finale act are a match made in heaven like ebbs visible only for a moment. The high table just shatters with those bombs one after the other anhilating the screen to smithereens.

Overall, John Wick along with the awe inspiring tonality brushed with magnificent camera work and excruciatingly long set pieces tricks you into a dreamy state of ecstasy and establishes a benchmark that will go down in history as a thesis on how to make memorable action films. After all who would have imagined that a party scene would show people with authority fighting their own hideous battles in the background unwithered by the careless mob taking care of business by recklessly dancing to the beats without substance. That was insanely beautiful Chad Stahelski.",9
varous-18960,"Best John Wick Movie so far. More actions in the movie. More interesting story. And mostly the last battle that's like the cowboy movie. 1v1. Men to men. So many places to get highlighted. And for god sake John Wick is frkin immortal. Enemy keep missing shots after shots. And there is Donnue Yen. One of my favorite actor. The battle music is very great. And mostly I like the part when the camera rotates like a FPS Tournament. They give you some rotating sort of effect and a top camera view. Totally like FPS tourney'and yes John Wick still love dogs. Best 2023 movie so far. But sadly it showed that Wick is dead. But hey, gotta be another movie because, Wick once faked his death (kind of). So looking forward to next part of this movie (If it's really another part).",9
greatbambino-56055,"My teenage children and I went to see John Wick 4 last night. We were all blown away by the nonstop action. For a 3 hour film it didn't have any weak spots in my opinion. The action scenes were great. The acting was great. A great movie overall.

To think, the writers of John Wick didn't have any intentions on writing a sequel. However, with the great reception of the first film they've now built an empire. In all sincerity, I think the first 3 films were iconic. When I read online when John Wick 4 first came out that most believe it's the best so far, I definitely had to see for myself. And YUP! To me and my children...John Wick 4 is definitely the best so far. AMAZING!!! That's not to say that 1-3 weren't amazing in itself, but this one packs a freaking punch! Ain't nobody got anything on Jardani Jovonovich...aka the BOOGEYMAN!

I remember watching some critics on a TV talkshow stating that John Wick is definitely one of the greatest action sagas ever but stated that the plot is average but the action is great. WHAT??? Evidently you critics are paying attention lol. The entire plot with the High Table is very intriguing. Of course it has some vagueness as to how the High Table was incepted, but that's the point. It leaves some mystery and is a great branch for continual films etc., etc., etc. I'm very much looking forward to more spinoffs. I'm a John Wick fan for life with both the good and the bad. Soooo, if you haven't seen any of the John Wicks...or at least haven't seen 4...SEE IT! SEE IT! SEE IT!!!

P. S. Rest in peace Lance Reddick!!!",10
nihal-38544,"I have no words for this movie. It was a long one but one action sequence after the other. The way they coordinated all the stunts and tried to show donnie yen and keanu together was amazing. They have upped every single installment but this here was a different level. The story was your everyday story but the way it was showcased was the main powerhouse of the whole film. The car scene near the circle was something crazy in a different way as people have probably shot those types of sequence but to do it so practically like they did in this movie was absurd. I will say that just to milk this series, they should stop at 5 and call it a day or it will see the same fall as fast and furious.",9
bisheshkumarthakur,"This film was action packed from begging to end! All of your questions in your mind will be answered.

The stunts and kills were just heart stopping craziness! The dark sense of humor was well delivered .Sentimental parts and adding reminiscent antidotes to foreshadow Johns path was amazing!!The cars , falling down stairs, shot, everything you can imaging.

bisheshkumarthakur,"Before entering john wick 4 you must understand the previous movies well obviously, but you gotta remember minor details like how the high table operates and some other stuff like bullet proof suits so u don't ask how don't they die right away.

John wick 4 is probably the best Action movie I've seen it's so diverse and not to mention the amazing cinematography and the action/ gun fights involved, I don't wanna spoil anything but cast choice was spot on some of the characters are just what can I say? Amazing to say the least, all villans victims and antagonists are played amazingly, each single character will play off a different vibe unlike anything you've seen before in any other movie, even newly introduced ones, filming locations as well are very well made and looks out of this world.

However nothing is perfect some plotholes are still here but they don't bother me whatsoever I can't mention all of them so I dont spoil but one of them when john fell of a high place he just got up And walked it off, baba yaga ha? Maybe he just trained his body hard lol, in this movie specifically keanus movement are very fast and he feels younger so thats a good thing, he trained after winston shot him off the building in part 3 Ofc some other plotholes like when civilians who barely react to someone who got shot or a car accident ik its not important but think about it people's reactions still is important to make a movie more realistic, tbh that's my only complaint, but why focus on these small details just enjoy the movie!

You'll be missing out if u didn't watch.",9
TomTalksFilms,"Prior to watching this film I committed one of the ultimate film watching sins of glancing over some of the reviews before having seen the film myself. I saw a lot of the more negative reviews saying this film felt more Bond esc than John Wick, going into the film I didn't understand what they meant but now I completely get it. John Wick first premiered in theatres 9 years ago and was a small hearty revenge tale action film that over time picked up a large audience of fans (me included). Much like any film that picks up a fan base it gets a sequel and now we're 4 films deep and going back to the whole bond thing this feels like the 4th film in an action film franchise and by that I mean everything is bigger, bigger and more stars, bigger and longer action set pieces and a bigger and more complex plot. Bigger however doesn't always mean better it's about what you do with it and what these films have done is turned into a franchise in every sense of the word. Lost is that small revenge thriller feel of the first film and now we have over the top villains like Bill Skarsgard who comes across as less menacing and more spoilt brat. We also have a protagonist that feels invincible at points laughably so, for instance John jumps out of a third floor window at one point lands on his back on top of a van and almost instantly gets up and walks off. There were a few of these 'yeah right' moments and they really took me out of the film temporarily. That being said however the film is far from a total lost, Donnie Yen is by far the stand out addition to the franchise, he steals every scene he's in and I definitely have a craving to go and watch more of his earlier work now. The action sequences despite being over the top at points are as slick and well choreographed as they were in the previous films and almost feel like a dance just a bloody and brutal one. The ending is also really solid and something we haven't seen before in a John Wick film, the film definitely leaves you on a high note.

I definitely enjoyed this film but compared to the other John Wick films it's down there with three as one of the weaker entries in the franchise for me.

I hope they stick with four films and that it doesn't get anymore over the top as after all Nobody does it better than Bond.",7
archer73,"Wow, what a film. Incredible production values and earnest acting and amazing stunts by all involved. Wardrobe, foley, set designers, editors, and MUAs were all the best of the best.

And yet the movie was a complete waste of time. I want it to make money for all involved, but I can't say that it was a good movie by any stretch of the imagination.

The American fetishization of guns was in full force here, as was the American hyperbole: ""Make it bigger, make it crazier, make it more wacky."" This film had all of that, but...character development? Forget about it. A plot that made sense? No way. An emotional through line? Barely.

It's true that we care about John Wick. We became invested in him four movies ago when they killed his dog. But watching this film is like watching that dog race around the room covered in tinsel and holidays lights, barking at shadows.

How many real-world problems can be solved by shooting something in the head? Twice? How many different ways to kill do we really need depicted on a seventy-five-foot screen? How much more glorification of psychotic criminal behavior must we really witness before we ourselves become psychotic?

This movie is like porn for gun nuts or for people who feel that they can punch their way out of their problems. There's a certain comedy about this that is kind of endearing. But it's just too much. There's a recurring theme that John can't escape whom he is and so he should stop trying. Is that what we should do as well? God, I hope there's more to life than that nihilism.

The best scene in the film embraced a Sisyphean ideal that, in its absurdity, was worth viewing. And maybe that's the point. Maybe John Wick is just crazy enough to make us stop and ask, ""Are we the crazy ones for viewing this? Can we ever be anything more? Should we try to find deeper meaning in our lives and relationships?"" I certainly hope so.",3
ChandRath,"John Wick 4 is an exceptional addition to the already gripping John Wick series. This movie is undoubtedly the best modern thriller that you can watch and and the best one of the series. Without revealing any spoilers, I can confidently say that the action sequences in this movie are some of the best that you will ever see. The top-down action sequence was particularly awe-inspiring, and it made me feel like I was playing AAA title like Max Payne 3. The way the action scenes are choreographed is simply outstanding, and it is something that has become synonymous with the John Wick series.

Overall, I would highly recommend John Wick 4 to anyone who is a fan of action movies. The level of excitement and intensity that this movie delivers is unmatched.",9
bhushantimla,"Just watched JohnWick4, long-awaited action franchise movie in 1st day-1st show here in Nepal..üá≥üáµ

This movie has so much full of action-packed sequences from the very start to the end, I didn't get time to sit on my seat properly.

Director Chad is highly acknowledged for his actions in past JW series, and he again scored his best to this movie.

All the action sequences are spine-chilling and the audiences love to watch them mesmerizingly.

This movie takes us to travel most of the world's famous places, and finally to Paris. And it shows Paris so beautiful, never been seen in any other movie before.

The level of direction, the cinematography and props used in the movie, and the sets were highly impressive!

But, there should be some less men should die in each action sequences to atleast 80% as of in the film, and then the bullet-proof suit should not save/protect JW from such huge rounds of bullets in the action.

When John said Winston to write 'loving husband' in his grave if he dies makes me feel so emotional.

Keanu as John Wich again truly deserve in the role. He looks like actual Mr. Wich more than a character.

Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and hopefully watching it once again in coming days.",9
joaquingemzon,"Gonna say this movie was absolutely amazing. I loved Donnie Yen's performance starring as Caine because of his unique fighting skills. Bill Skarsgard as the Marquis was also wonderful, really felt like he wasn't just another villain, he was also a much bigger threat to Wick unlike his past adversaries. I also got somewhat nervous at the very start as I felt like Bill Skarsgard's character was a very intimidating one. The very last ending made me consider that Caine needs more of his backstory. Overall, I loved this movie I've been following Keanu's JW since the first release and was really pumped up when number 4 came out. Easily a 10 for meüî•üí™!",10

To sum up where this movie went wrong, just watch the episode of the office where Micheal explains the downfall of the Diehard series. Also the plot and character motivations make absolutely no sense. It's only 5/10 because choreography was really well done. You believe he knows how to actually shoot but at the end of the day John Wick is supposed to be human, not a mix of wolverine, Hawkeye, and have a suit that doubles as captain America's shield.

Add actors you know and love, have them deliver a few wooden lines over a scenario covering a pretextual plot, and fill the rest with mindless action. Sounds great in theory (if you're into this stuff anyway) but at what duration does this become too much? It's obvious our ""hero"" will take it to the very end, so what's the deal with the ridiculous amount of obstacles?

Everything was so much over the top it felt pointless. Too much choreographed action, extremely unrealistic, felt like a videogame with infinite villains, infinite ammo and infinite stamina, complete with NPC's dancing their a**es off to techno music while next to them bad guys get axes stabbed in their heads -- this tune is banging though, yeeeaaahhh!

Well, this JW4 has nothing off all these, NOTHING.

This movie has the poorest story - basically revenge but presented in most uninterested, poor and generic way.

The plot doesn't have anything of value about head of the high table, its plans, nothing of value about high table, about the big things that goes in the background, etc The ""acting"" of Keanu if baffling - he either cannot or dont care at all to act.

The same with the actions scenes which are comically bad and bizarre - extremely long, slow, waves of lifeless dolls against the invincible hero.

Never seen any of the others but you don't need to know anything about John Wick to get rock hard at your local theater from the Action.

The masterful cinematography, steady and quick to focus you see every gunshot and punch thrown by the almost UnKillable John Wick. There's one scene with a top down shot that is honestly the best choreography I've ever seen.

Reeves' physicality and commitment to the role shine through in every fight scene, making John Wick an instantly iconic action hero.

I give it 5 bags of popcorn and a little cane for Donny Yen's performance as Caine, the blind marshal artist.

camlacey-04880,"*spoilers ahead*

Long time action movie buff here. I went into this film having watched the previous 3 John Wicks and thinking that I knew what to expect. I was wrong.

This movie is incredibly tedious. The fight scenes, while choreographed well, are nothing new and they drag on and become extremely repetitive over the three hour run time.

This is not helped by the fact that everyone now wears magical kevlar suits that stop bullets, so now Wick gets to shoot people 4-5 times each without effect before finally closing in and either shooting or stabbing them in the head.

That brings me to my next point. This movie asks for a RIDICULOUS amount of suspension of disbelief from the audience.

The most outrageous example perhaps being that we are supposed to accept that Donnie Yens character is blind and yet can somehow outshoot and out swordfight trained assassins over and over again. HOW exactly?

Then there was John Wicks ability to absorb superhuman levels of damage (whether falling from a building or being hit by cars, it has about as much effect as hitting him with a pool noodle) This, combined with the bulletproof suit made him seemingly invincible.

The movie culminates with John Wick spending about 20 minutes casually mowing down a hundred or so men very publicly in the heart of Paris, many in front of passing vehicles at a major landmark. Apparently there are no police in Paris, as none ever show up.

When John Wick fell down the stairs I chuckled, but then groaned in synch with the character as I realised that he now had to fight his way back up again. At that point I really just wanted the movie to end.

Neither the plot or script is smart or witty, the action was repetitive and I could not suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy the film. As a result I spent a large portion of the run time thinking ""HE'S BLIND JUST SHOOT HIM!""

It was a real struggle to sit through this one.",6
miuragikenuser,"I have seen all the John Wick movies from 1 to 3 so I understand and follow the story. All the movies have something in common, gunfight in a club scene with techno music. Is it because the producer used to go clubbing when he was young? I have no idea but it is cool.

My thoughts on the 4th movie, it is good but the suspense is gone. When I finished watching the 1st movie, I looked forward to see the 2nd movie. But after the 3rd movie, I was thinking the producer was just trying too hard to push it to the 4th. There is one scene in the 4th movie that is unnecessary. I dont like the gun fight at the stairs near the church. It is just unrealistic and taking too long. There were like 100 bad guys against the Terminator? About the ending, well, confusing. What happened? It is not clear. Overall, it is good but not as good as the 2nd movie.

Thanks for reading....",7
quickpicksusa,"John Wick Chapter 4 was one of the most awaited sequels of 2023. After what happened at the end of Chapter 3, I was interested to know what will happen next.

The movie was fully action-packed like the previous installments but the action scenes were more intense this time. The story was a simple continuation of the previous part. The performances by all the cast members were good and memorable.

One different and new thing I noticed in this part was that the movie had a lot of emotional elements attached to it. This felt a little bit weird to me as the previous installments only focused on action and nothing else. I faced one more problem and that was the pacing of the movie. The movie felt fast at some moments and slow at other moments, in other words, the pacing was inconsistent. The runtime also felt a little bit long but the overall experience doesn't get affected by it.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie and it was a good entry in the John Wick franchise even after having the same old story.",10
anifowosehabeeb,"While most people watch John Wick for the fight scenes, it's also notable to mention the top notch acting from main and supporting casts. My favourite moments from this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the fight scenes (they were awesome by the way), but interactions between the casts. Example is Scott Adkins as Killa Harkan. Though he is a supporting cast and had around 15 minutes of screen time, it's probably one of the best 15 minutes of any movie. Coming back to the fight scenes, they are still very very good. The only criticism I have is that some of the fight scenes drag along too long. This is one of the few good movies that deserve every single penny of your money. Give it a watch.",9
matty_moleskin,"Some context, of all the John Wick's, I'd seen the 2nd one, and thought it was great. However, after a 20 minute YouTube recap of all 3 I felt I was good to go. Although rather unnecessary as the movie is pretty easy to follow. So don't think it's important to have seen the others.

I'll keep this simple:

If you want to see 3 hours of well choreographed non-stop violence with some questionable decisions from the surrounding members of the public and some unfathomable bone break escapes from Mr Wick. Then this movie is for you.

Went to see it in a packed IMAX and so many people around me were visibly bored and audibly exasperated with the movie.

The one saving grace was a hilarious slapstick stairs moment towards the end which had the whole cinema laughing out loud.

I did enjoy the warriors homage too.

In a nutshell, if you want an excuse to eat a large popcorn then you'll have 3 action packed but long hours to get to the hard kernels at the bottom.",4
goiabinhadobem,"To start this analysis I need to say that I watched the other three films in the franchise and found them to be good films, not great, much less excellent, but this film was something else.

Seeing this film in the cinema I had a very good experience, the sound in the speakers makes the experience something far superior than seeing it on your TV, so please, see the film in the cinema while it is still showing.

For us to contextualize the story of the film, John Wick is seeking his freedom from the High Table in his last attempt to have his freedom.

The story of the 4th film is good, nothing that makes it memorable or sensational, but it acts in line with the duration of the film and long shots of the fight, which in this film are sensational, with different ways of seeing John Wick's fights, with cameras superiors, different scenarios and lightings for each fight and different weapons for each fight.

The technical aspects of this film stand out from the previous ones in the franchise, with great sound work and photography that you don't see in films of the genre, with beautiful open shots of the city and the fights, costumes similar to other films in the franchise, with nothing different and that production design that we already know from the franchise, with numerous extras with large structures.

Already going deeper into the action of the film, I would say it is innovative, intense and sensational. Its long shots bring us a reality in the fights and the different fighting weapons like samurai swords, bats, guns and martial arts with several different scenarios for each fight plan.

One thing that I would like to say is good in the film are its references to Lawrence of Arabia in the first minutes of the film, such as the famous match edition, the open shots of the Arabian desert and the clothes being a classic reference to the classic film.

Already bringing a negative point are some absurdities of fights and narratives, but it is not something that makes you stay away from the experience.

Grade 8.4/10.

If I could watch it, watch it because worth.",8
pablomatas,"Best movie in the franchise imo, it's an action movie but it seems more than that, the atmosphere makes it look like a piece of art, beautiful photography. Amazing stunts done by Keanu Reeves that I consider one of the best action actors, Bill Skarsg√•rd is good but there is something in there that makes me feel weird, good characters. Amazing sequences of action with some sequence shots that are absolutely fabulous. Good story, well developed. Some bad dialogues, some towards the end when it tries to be very epic and dramatic, it is but more when it does not try to be. Good ending to John Wick.",8
jazzinplayer,"This movie is just too good. My favorite John Wick so far and a very good wrap up for the whole story.

You can expect John Wick being John Wick at its finest, more relentless than ever and unstoppable, literally unstoppable.

I think they improved many things from previous iterations deliveign a very well done product. The pace is wonderful, the action scenes are energetic and fulfilling. You even feel tired like wanting him to take a break.

They did a great job with the narrative, story telling is much better, much easier to follow up and understand the plot.

That close quarters, Rainbow six combat scene it's just something else man, you can't get enough of that. Bravo!!",8
petrxpp,"John Wick has completely broken free from his chains. Great visuals, excellently filmed action scenes that push the boundaries a little further. The almost three-hour event started in one breath, which, in addition to absolutely famous choreography, offers the art of sophisticated tricks with the camera and those that have not yet been seen in the flood of thousands of films. All the action sequences are an accurate demonstration of the fact that in the right creative hands they will show the audience something new and unseen for the fourth time. A quality work that surpasses all action movies and unfortunately sends them to the corner to cry. That's how filmmaking is done. Stahelski vivat, but next time a little more logic in the scenario.",7
wesoly-68543,So before watching this piece of really uncooked pasta i watched again three previous movies and with great regret I have to say each movie after another are getting worse and generic and predictable. Plot is there just to justify the fight scene after another one. Some people write the fight scenes are on another level I do not agree. For me they seem like a choreography and sluggish. Way to many moves to finish off an opponent. Did anyone count how may times John shot his gun from the car at the huge roundabout? 38 times give and take and just in previous scene when he got the gun from the King he said it holds 21 bullets!!!! Apparently this is not the last one John Wick but just like Fast and Furious this movie gets just ridiculous. Keanu please just stop!!!!,4
bigimagesigns-1,"This movie is not a masterpiece. It's fun cinema and skilled action choreography, yes it is.

BUT not a masterpiece.

For it to be that, it would need to: 1. Have a runtime of 2hrs (Not the bloated, self indulgent 3hrs that is) EDIT more!

2. Less of John Wick falling from buildings, diving out of windows and especially falling down the STAIRS!...just LESS of all that!...its like he has Fast n Furious or Xmen or super soldier powers...or did he sell his soul to the devil? Death walks, sure i get....but it's just too much sometimes and it becomes corny, less dangerous or no consequences.

That ridiculous Stairs scene became like a Mel Brooks movie to me (a joke, the wrong tone) 3. It needs Better writing.. with at least a dozen quotable quotes, that stay with you (like Aliens or Die Hard has n does)... Can anyone think of any awesome quotes besides his ""Yeahhh""? I cant.

4. Also, Donny Yen should not of been blind, it was too unbelievable all the time, He was an equal to Daredevil? No, he didnt have superpowers sonar radar.....However, his character was cool and i enjoyed him, but i would of enjoyed him even more if he could see. He could of been a cocky but most skilled ninja without being blind.

LOL, i kept expecting him to say ""The Fowce"" ;)

Also it would benefit to occasionally be little bit more raw and dusty, less polished and Slick ALL THE TIME (the first Chapter was like that ;)

for me 6.7/10.",6
tanguy-53335,"This movie is so nice. The action scenes are incredible amazing choreography and they don't afraid to let every action scenes goes on for a long time too. Which might be problem for some people but I didn't get bored at all. It's so colorful and so nice to look at and they also change location a lot so there's a lot of variety and creative fight scenes.

In this movies they also introduce a lot of new characters and they're all awesome . My favorite character is Donnie Yen he's is really charismatic and got a creative way of fighting and he's appear throughout the whole movie not just some side character that studio give a little screen time just to get some quick money from a fan.

The story I think it's better than quite a few people said. It's not a masterpiece in story telling or anything but it's fun. The pacing is nice. It's have a lot of cool character moments. It's not waste to much time to get you from action to action scenes and I think it's conclude in a satisfying way. Lot of funny stuff too.

If i had to nitpicking I'd say the villians is not that great but the real antogonist is Donnie Yen anyway. And there's a few time you just have to suspend disbelief a little bit like a dance culb scene for example. They go for amazing aesthetic and not so much a realistic depiction.

Oh and the use of soundtrack and music is awesome.

All and all just a really fun action well shot film that will keep you entertained for nearly 3 hours and this come from a guy that's not an action movie fan. Highly recommended.

8.5/10.",8
aaronlong-60751,"I don't even know how to start this review... I mean wow just wow! John Wick: Chapter 4 has a runtime of 2 hours and 50 minutes, and it NEVER feels like it. This movie is an action-packed spectacle on EVERY level.

I believed the action in Chapter 3 couldn't be outdone... oh boy, was I wrong. The action in this is some of the most astonishing I've ever seen in film or television. The incredible, vibrant, sleek cinematography showcased throughout adds nicely to the already intense action sequences. I feel like I have to give major props to the cinematographer Dan Laustsen, who is a master of his craft. The cinematography is likewise reinforced by the brilliant locations and sets exhibited. Not once was an area dull, every single location was beautifully vibrant. Another significant boost for this film is the epic and invigorating soundtrack that is flawlessly utilized.

The cast of characters in this film are all fleshed out and very well written. Donnie Yen does an outstanding job portraying the bad-ass yet suave Caine. Bill Skarsg√•rd also does a fantastic job playing the powerful and egocentric Vincent de Gramont. The lead, Keanu Reeves, once again kills it as the undoubtedly ferocious John Wick.

This movie may very well go down as one of the best action films of the 21st century, and in my opinion, it is a title that is well deserved.",10
gjqnfbnkq,"John Wick 1-4 are the greatest action movies of all time. John Wick 4 really ups the ante, nonstop action back-to-back for 3 hours. Cudos to everyone who worked on this movie, pure work of art. The cinematography is aesthetic. The plot is interesting and engaging with many twists. The action scenes are unbeatable, and plenty. The movie has exceeded my expectations, I couldn't ask for more. I attended the premier and left the theater with a big fat smile on my face. John Wick is the GOAT. I don't know how feasible it is plot-wise, but I really want a chapter 5. This is the first time I write a movie review. That's how good it is!",10
edwinhamberg,"By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema.",10
guidetosuccesslife,"Ahhhhhh le creme de la creme!!!!!!!!!

I am simply confirming that all you have heard about the 4th installment in the John Wick series is true. This is by far the most accomplished Action, crime, thriller to date. The last time I've seen a movie this violently good was in Chow Yun Fat's break out role 34 Years ago called ""The Killer"". To this day I still don't know how they were able to fire so many bullets in one movie!!!üòÖ JW4 is equally up there for the most bullets fired in a movie. A staggering logistical accomplishment on its own I won't be surprised if they win an award of some kind for that. The average movie goer looking into the franchise for the first time with this installment would be lost as to why the need to escalate to such madness. This is why if this is your thing and you haven't by some miracle seen the first 3 movies, you need to make that a priority before you go see this final chapter.

With that aside the movie is a masterpiece. The best movie makers at the top of their skill set have successfully combined a great script, formidable actors, intricate set design, and special effects magic for a one of a kind spectacle that will definitely be remembered. I can not write this piece without mentioning the stand out performances of Bill Skarsgard(breakout new actor who plays pennywise from the movie ""It"") Scott Adkins(world renowned martial artist and Actor) Hiroyuki Sanada(Acclaimed Japanese action star) and Donnie Yen( World renowned martial artist and famed Chinese Actor) there characters gave the movie an extreme edge and a plethora of truly exiting moments. The entire cast brought their""A"" game. What an ensemble!!!

Other note worthy mentions was that the film was dedicated to the late Lance Reddick who played the concierge for the New York Continental Hotel in all 4 films. Lance sadly passed away a few weeks prior to the release of the final chapter, they honored him as well as he honored his roll. Despite it's violent nature, the movie promotes heavy moral values such as unconditional Love, True friendship, Honor, Respect,and the concept of Fealty.

Retrospectively...yeah...I was literally on the edge of my seat the entire time. I would like to think that I am as nice of a guy as they come. I wouldn't begin to condone violence in any form shape or manner. However there is the innate awareness that violence is intrinsically a human trait, and very rarely do we have a Bruce Willis( Die Hard) Charles Bronson( Death Wish) Clint Eastwood( Dirty Harry) Mel Gibson( Lethal Weapon) Sylvester Stallone(Rambo) Tom Cruise( Mission Impossible) and now Keanue Reeves( John Wick) kind of film that inspires the good in all of us to fight for what is right!!!!!

P. S. Hats off to the tailors of this movie. I've never seen that many beautiful suits ruined in one movie. ü§£ ""Those who cling to death Live, those who cling to life die.""",10
botanic-21273,"Keanu Reeves is terrific. I like the way he walks and talks with a singular rhythm. Sets the tone for a lot of the scenes. Like a native English speaking Terminator.

Firstly much appreciation for the stunt work. There are a lot of impressive things in here but the simple, relatively speaking, falls require a lot of work and generally they look great. Some, probably all, of the fight scenes drag on too long although special mention to the sequence in a building shot from above. I thought that was superb.

Some of the set design is beautiful. Some of the shots that appear on screen are not and look cheap, in todays terms. When you see the film you'll know what I mean. Sunrise over Paris anyone?

Lots of action and in keeping with the previous films lots of honourable reasons for that action.

Not sure the concept of mixing a film with a dodgy Bond villain with Bourne like action scenes and a major character from Blind Fury is a great idea.

If you do get bored watching this film you can play, ""Place the Accent""

There are no prizes but you might struggle to work out where anyone is from

Nice to see Clancy Brown and the dog was fantastic without having to rely on the ""cute animal"" syndrome. (It did get the biggest laugh)

honestopinion1,"I have always been a huge fan of John Wick movies. The first movie I never saw in the theaters. I saw it on video and then I was hooked. I saw all of the previous John Wick movies in there theaters. I walked out of each one truly entertained and satisfied. For me, a good movie keeps me entertained and guessing what will come next. Sadly to say, this was the first John Wick movie when I said to myself, ""how many gun fights are there,"" in this movie. I actually thought it was a little too much in this last film. The action is non-stop but it all just seemed to be the same thing. Wish there was a little more to the plot. This is not the way I would have ended the franchise.",7

I couldn't even blink. I have to admit this is my favourite from all Keanu Reeves movies. Amazing performance, make up, sound, locations etc. It was incredible.

At the same time, I love the way Winston was there, the iconic Continental Hotel, the brand, the family, etc. In other action movies it feels really fake when it comes to revenge because of family situations but in this one I love the way that really he had to become part of the family to fight.",10
qumbernasim,What a sequel - glad I made my time today with such a mind ravishing and brain stimulative action and real time videography especially in indoor drone coverage and over the top of it the ballistic were so powerfully sounded that every bullets was deeply attained with audio effects. Made my night and my wife usually avoid action films but this is a game changer for her and now she's all the previous chapters. It is been a while that action movies are acknowledged but John Wick alter all the stages towards new era. I went to France and looked romantic city with bullets in the air. Great work done.,9
spokanemac-63794,"John Wick four I want my two hours of my life back. This Has to be the worst of all three films. John Wick doesn't talk much and even with all the bullets flying around apparently even when they strike these guys don't die. The first 15 minutes of the most unbelievable. Bullets flying everywhere and they are deflected even if when they hit the body what's up with that? The blind guy fighting is pretty good. Even when he gets caught, he's released to carry on the mission so he can get back into the organization. Who pays the bounty for his death is never spoken about what organization is this, and who's betting.",4
patriciajordan-59381,"Painful 3 hours watching ridiculous stunts and a weak storyline. I like action movies and thought John Wick 3 was really good, but this is a waste of money and time. Over the top! It feels more like a video game for teens where you need to kill 500 people than an action movie. Not sure why some people rate this so high and give it a 9/8. Maybe the grand locations and the beautiful settings, including the massive club in Berlin are amazing, but the way the movie is told is kind of disrespectful to viewers. Great action movies are not about getting shot over 5000 times, Hit by cars and falling down 400 steps without a scratch!",4
mercyofsea,"John Wick 4 raises the bar for action films with its mind-blowing fight scenes that leave audiences in awe. The choreography and execution of the action sequences are nothing short of exceptional, showcasing a level of skill and creativity that sets a new standard for the genre. From the fast-paced and clear fight sequences to the variety of weapons, styles, and locations, the film delivers an action-packed experience that is a treat for action junkies.

The cinematography and music complement the action perfectly, enhancing every scene and immersing viewers in the stylistic beauty of the film. Additionally, the movie introduces some creative and innovative shots that bring a fresh perspective to the action genre. There are moments that feel like they are ripped straight out of a video game, captivating audiences and leaving them in a state of amazement.

While the second half of the film may have a few flaws, such as a less consequential subplot and some repetition of previous elements, the overall experience is still a thrilling ride. Despite these minor issues, the level of excitement and entertainment provided by the action sequences overshadows any shortcomings. John Wick 4 deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the loudest speakers to truly appreciate its jaw-dropping action.

In conclusion, John Wick 4 is an action landmark that sets a new standard for fight scenes in the genre. While it may not be perfect, the incredible action sequences, stunning cinematography, and innovative shots make it a must-watch for any action movie enthusiast. Prepare to be immersed in a world of intense fights, creative kills, and non-stop adrenaline.",7

All these positive reviews were given either by fifth graders or most likely by corrupt crooks. I'm ashamed to have seen that stuff. I'm disappointed in the acting of actors I respected. I feel bad for anyone who were forced to watch the movie for longer than two hours without being able to fast-forward through the most absurd and uncomfortable parts.

Seems almost like someone else directed, shot and edited the first half of the movie and only the 2nd half was put together by the main people. Very very weird feeling movie.

silverlight-91083,"No spoilers, just to say that it is worth a watch for action fans. Plot is weak, the film is really just a sequence of very long drawn out and unrealistic fight setpieces....which nevertheless are well shot. Unrealistic because the skill with which every single fighter in the movie (and there are literally hundreds if not thousands of them) can dodge bullets is ridiculous. Suffice to say, the ratio of gunshots on target at close range (within 1-2 metres) is about 1 in 10. Either the fighters are impossibly good at dodging bullets or else they have become so adept at unarmed combat that their gun firing skills have become nonexistent.",7

Another highlight is the choreography combined with a very well done job by the special effects team that had almost no continuity errors.

The story itself does not innovate, but still manages to focus on what really matters, making the story unfold as good as the previous films.

Finally the conclusion of the film delivers everything it promises and simultaneously tries not to turn the main character into a superhero.

The actor bill don't ask me to spell his second name because that is a mouthful lol but he did do an incredible job for the action probably the best action you will likely see in an action movie again incredible keanu reeves did an amazing job that's what got me liking keanu reeves after seeing the first chapter the scene at the end was different and in my opinion spoiled it a little bit.,7
bjornbroers,"In my opinion this movie is the best action movie ever made. It is so immersive when you are watching it, the set design, the choreography and the realistic stunt scenes are excellent and therefore completely drag you into the movie. Chad Stahelski added exactly the perfect amount of action into the movie, not too much and not too few. It had enough scenes about John Wick's background in the movie (in my opinion) and the new characters really were a good addition to the movie. The scene that was shot from above (the old apartment fight scene) was unbelievably good, the set was so well decorated, the soundtrack was very good and the stunts in this and all other scenes were perfect. So for me this was definitely the best movie I have ever seen. That is why I rated it with 10 stars because for me it was worth at least 10.",10

I would like to rate it higher but unfourtunately this movie defies logic too much. Moreover, you might never actually fear for the main character's life because John Wick is pretty much indestructible at this point, which reduces the thrill and makes the movie feel repetitive and pointless. Nevertheless, if you can put that aside, you'll have a great time watching this visually gorgeous movie.",8
reaganreviews,"Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 4 brings the John Wick franchise to an explosive conclusion. The film follows John Wick as he travels the globe, battling old and new foes to earn his freedom. The film stars Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, and Bill Skarsg√•rd.

This film has the best action of the franchise, provided by what seems like all of the stunt performers in Hollywood. The fight choreography is impressive and complex. Even though the film is nearly three hours long, I never got bored as the action sequences were very entertaining. Like the previous John Wick films, many of the action sequences feature ""gun-fu,"" a mix of firearms and hand to hand combat. I was also surprised by the comedic aspect of some of the action, as many scenes have an almost slapstick nature.

Another aspect of the film that was expertly executed was the film's cinematography and set design. Many of the fight scenes occurred in interesting settings that utilized vibrant and appealing colors. The fight scenes were also captured with long takes, showcasing all of the difficult choreography that the actors had to memorize. A certain action sequence comes to mind when thinking of cinematography, which was especially impressive. This scene was captured from a bird's eye view, similar to a video game and there were no visible cuts during this scene.

Speaking of video games, this film improved on the previous film's shortcoming: the story. While the events of the last film felt inconsequential, this film returned to the franchise's roots, delivering a simple story with great action. The film's story is structured like a video game, with John Wick having to complete clear and simple objectives. Many of these objectives lead to boss fights, where the film's side characters shine. A memorable and recurring boss was the legendary Donnie Yen, who played an antagonist that you almost wanted to root for.

My only issue with the film is a plot hole during the film's first act. This plot hole was that John Wick was in a certain location for no apparent reason. Unfortunately, his presence in this location is a very important aspect of the film.

John Wick: Chapter 4 is an excellent action film that features spectacular action scenes, memorable side characters, and an entertaining Keanu Reeves at the top of his game. While the film isn't based on a video game, it certainly felt like a video game brought to the big screen.",9
rohitabstract,"After chapter 3 of the Wick series, I had set my expectations down a bit. It missed a lot of the best things which were present in the previous movies. But Chapter 4 delivered...and in what manner.

All the missing elements are back and in better form - the music, action which surprises you, the moments where people just sit and talk (instead of overwhelming you with non-stop action) and new likeable characters. New elements to the mix are some creative camera angles and excellent use of cars in action scenes making you sit on the edge of seat.

Easily the best action movie I recall in recent times(besides Mad Max: Fury Road). This is worth watching many times on the big screen !",9
miljanastojkovic-84931,"John Wick first part is the only thing worth watching. What have I watch for 2 and a half hours in cinema? Only useless gunshots and unrelated actions. Every guy needs to be shot a least 20 time to be dead. It became annoying to watch so many guys that were attacking him, shootings with no meaning. And my ears needed time to recover after so many shooting. Very dissapointed in Keanu Reeves for accepting this kind of production scenario. The only positive thing here is the dog that appears 10min total in the whole movie.

I liked the end, when he died, i hope that means no more John Wick parts..",3
riegray,"I have been a fan of these films but this one was just too much and at times boring

The fight sequences at first were great but there is a saying of ""to much of a good thing"" And this describes this film perfectly.

I got to point of being bored of the fighting , it was all the same with the bad guys not being able to shoot or even hit properly and the good guys being slow and perfect

Mr nobody his dog - I have no idea what the point of them were in this movie apart from reminding of you of John wicks dog in the first movie they both had no point and no real story in this film .

The whole thing in my honest opinion was boring ! Even after a bottle of wine I couldn't really see the point of it!

hanson-stephenj,"The answer to the question in the title is: never. John Wick is the exception. This is a highly intelligent, visceral action movie with room to grow, even after this being the fourth in the series.

You know how Marvel has its universe with spin-offs for main characters? That's how I foresee the future of John Wick. I want more movies, focusing on more cities, chapters, and characters in the universe these movies have created. Cane alone would make a phenomenal addition to the series, and deserves his own film.

lawrencegaming,"Saw this film with my friends, it's the first John Wick film I have seen. I'm all for action movie stars having plot armour, but this is next level. Superhero movies are more realistic than this. Batman is notorious for plot armour and compared to john wick's plot armour it's nothing.

First off - do the police not exist? How is there 30min of gunfire/explosions in a hotel in japan and there's not a single siren? Same thing in Paris - an entire night of warzone-level fighting and no sirens? None?

Has john wick evolved to be immune to lactic acid? How is he fighting, running, jumping for literally an entire night in France without rest, no water, no food, no breaks, and somehow is about as tired as Usain Bolt after running a 100m? Not even olympic-gold winning athletes have this stamina. And ontop of that, he has perfect aim and the durability of Deadpool.

Are his bones made of diamonds? Is he immune to trauma? How is he jumping face first out of the 4th floor of a building and walking off like nothing happened? Is his head made of shock absorbing Vibranium? How else is he falling multiple times down hundreds of steps, hitting his head, and still able to walk? I don't care who you are - if you are being run over by cars, smashing your head against concrete and jumping out of buildings all within 1 night - at the very LEAST you walk away with a few broken bones if not severe internal bleeding.

How on earth did hundreds of assassins carrying insanely heavy weaponry not manage to put a single bullet in his head? And the rest of his body is covered via a magical suit that somehow has infinite durability. Yeah, that's not how bulletproof suits work.

Somehow, John Wick can be hit by multiple cars and get up. But if anyone else gets hit by a car, they die instantly.

Does John Wick have the scavenger perk? Somehow, after firing thousands of bullets he doesn't run out of ammo?

Oh, and let's not forget the blind man that magically knows where everyone is and has aimbot. This guy is a daredevil ripoff but.. without superpowers?

The ending scene was drawn out far too long. Falls down the stairs 100+ times - just end it already. And after killing hundreds of assassins with a pistol, being hit by multiple cars, jumping out of buildings, he dies to a gunshot wound inflicted by a literal blind guy.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for unrealistic fighting scenes. The Punisher somehow killing 50+ people with 0 superpowers? Sure. John Wick killing hundreds after fighting for hours non-stop, after suffering numerous injuries that would paralyze or kill any normal person? No.

2/10. Camera work was good, that's it.",3
manzira-730-293353,"I haven't read all the reviews, so pardon my ignorance if my comment is repetitive. I was highly amused by the director's ""borrowing"" of scenes from the movie ""The Warriors"" during John Wick's travails during his journey to reach the site of the final duel. Especially obvious were the scenes where lady radio announcer provided the play-by-play location of John while exhorting the mob chasing him to pick up the pace. It was such a flashback for me that I thought for a moment that it was the same announcer from ""The Warriors"", except she would be much older now. Maybe this and the whole final chase sequence were easter eggs provided by the director and producers as a nod to the original action-packed sequence leading to the ultimate conclusion. Then again maybe ""The Warriors"" borrowed it to pay homage to an earlier movie.

Otherwise, a great action movie for the ages. I was exhausted at the end, nothing was left on the table. If in fact John Wick is dead, it was a satisfying ending.",9

ashton092295,"Keanu hit gold with this movie series! Lots of the stuff we seen but different in a good way. Amazing ending! You officially topped all my action star list and some more. The easter eggs and The Warriors flashback was genius. I do hope you get the recognition that is well deserved with all the hard work you put into these movies! You will always be praised for your talents and your humility Keanu. We need more of you in the world. Regardless I don't think we have seen the end of the talent and dedication this man has. The top view scene was off the hook!! Amazing! Skip the Matrix stuff, the writers don't know what they are doing anymore. Much love my man! RIP Lance you will be missed!",10
rjhall-291-668108,"First of let's just get this out of the way, the action is great in this movie. It's precisely as expected: brutal in some ways, artful in others. Unfortunately, at certain points you really have to wonder if they ran out of choreographers when the fights seem to drag on rather excessively and without much variation. Improvised weaponry was rarer than before, and you'd kind of expect some variety in it. Most of all, some of the choreography is downright lazy. There are points in fight scenes where men wearing Kevlar lined 3 piece suits take multiple bullets, which make little sparks and they're otherwise unfazed. They wrote John this absurd trick where he holds up his suit jacket like Batman's cape and now he's magically immune to bullets. Each movie departed from realism a bit more; this chapter just threw it in the trash. It's just a superhero movie without powers.

Now the story, on the other hand, leaves much more to be desired. The pacing is incredibly slow, to the point where you sometimes just lose the plot entirely. Very few familiar characters spend more than a few minutes on screen, and the new characters who hog the spotlight are shallow and forgettable.

Lastly, the pacing is awful, in some part due to the large run time. Fight scenes drag on far too long, while most conversations are so short and unsubstantial that they might as well not have occurred at all. I truly hope this was studio pressure, and that Stahelski releases a director's cut to remedy this. I can only assume there's dialog and complex choreography that were cut in lieu of the popcorn stuff.",6
javed02,"I would like to start with a story about scorpion and sage: A wise and peaceful sage sees a scorpion drowning in the river and decides to rescue it. He lifts the scorpion out of the water, but the scorpion stings him and he drops it back. The sage tries again, but the scorpion stings him once more. The sage does not give up and attempts to save the scorpion for the third time, but he gets stung again. He asks the scorpion why it keeps hurting him when he is trying to help. The scorpion replied, ""I cannot help it. It is my nature to sting.""

The moral of the story is that some creatures cannot change their nature and it is important to accept this fact and act accordingly.

This story applies to John Wick, a hitman who cannot escape his identity as an assassin. One character from the movie tells John that he is an assassin, and despite his efforts to get out of the business, he can't deny who he is. Even though John tries to avoid violence, he keeps getting pulled into it, and it's inevitable that he will continue to be a killer.

The movie is a classic genre movie: action. The action genre in movies is a type of film that typically features fast-paced and thrilling physical stunts, fights, and chases. In the end, you do not feel cheated.

One of the dialogues: ""The bloodshed wasn't necessary. But the bloodshed was the point."" It seems like the characters do not seek to achieve any goal or outcome by shedding blood, but rather they enjoy the act itself as an end in itself. They only care about satisfying their bloodlust and proving their dominance.

We often think that action is the best way to solve our problems and achieve our goals. But is that always true? What if our actions have negative consequences or go against our moral values? These questions challenge us to think more deeply about what it means to act and how our actions affect ourselves and others.

The movie has amazing and beautiful action scenes. The stunts are awesome, and, again, the gunfights look more like dance moves. Wick is always so smooth and clever when he fights.

The abundance of locations and vivid colors present a visual treat that is unmatched. The vivid imagery sets the perfect tone, both for the action and the dialogue. This movie offers an exceptional sensory journey, a rare treat not often found in action films. Every frame is dripping with texture and layers. There are so many things happening in the foreground and background, and yet you are never confused about what you have to focus on.

The story of John Wick, brought to life by the masterful acting of Keanu Reeves, is a tale of human suffering and redemption. Wick, once a man of simple desires, finds himself thrust into a world of violence and revenge, driven by his past traumas and the desire for retribution.

Reeves understands the depth of his character's suffering and portrays Wick not as a mere killing machine, but as a man with a soul that has been wounded by loss and grief. Despite the constant physical punishment he endures, Wick never loses sight of his humanity, and his pain only serves to reinforce his determination.

Through Wick's struggles, we see the timeless truth that suffering is an inherent part of the human experience.

One of the key tenets of stoicism is the idea that we should be indifferent to external circumstances. This does not mean that we should be unfeeling, but rather that we should strive to maintain a sense of inner calm. John Wick embodies this idea in many ways. Despite the numerous threats he faces, he remains calm and focused.

Another important principle is the idea that we should focus on what we can control, rather than worrying about what we cannot. John Wick exemplifies this idea in his single-minded pursuit of his goals. When someone threatens him, he does not waste time on fruitless worry or despair. Instead, he takes action to protect himself and those around him, using his skills and experience.

In short, John Wick is not just a deadly assassin, but also a stoic philosopher. Through his actions and demeanor, he embodies many of the key principles of stoicism.

John Wick 4 is action cinema turned into high art by creators who believe that every single one of the countless kills in this movie still has to look cool as hell. Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers exactly what you want from a John Wick film.",10
boedicia50,"Sorry to say, but this could and should have been a tight 90 minutes long. I'm not sure how it even was 2 hours 49 minutes as not much really happened in the way of story.

Yes, the choreography of the many fights is amazing - the top down sequence in an house is very well done.

As many have pointed out, making John Wick pretty much impervious to pain or damage makes it all rather predictable. The complete disinterest of law enforcement to the proceedings is one thing, but people continuing to dance while baddies take axes to the head around them is just farcical.

So an enjoyable if flawed action movie in need of some heavy editing.",7
Terrorformer,"Yes I know John Wick is a tough guy but goddamn does he get put thru the ringer lol. I was honestly laughing towards the end of this movie because he gets thrown of a 15 foot balcony to the floor, beat up all to hell, hit by many vehicles, jumped out of a 3 story window and racked himself on a van, gets thrown down several flights of stairs. Amongst many other things and just keeps chugging along like nothing. Not to mention getting shot and stabbed in the last movie.

You stop and think... it's been like 3 days straight of absolute punishment for this guy lmao.

Anyway I just had to put that out there. But like c'mon... who cares right? These movies are awesome. They're made for fans of martial arts and action movies and man does it deliver! It's insane how much action is actually here.

I will say that the movie probably could've been trimmed at least a bit. It is quite long and you feel it by the end. But I get it. We're near the end of this series of movies and they wanna give it this epic conclusion.

I could go on and on about this movie honestly but I'm going to end it here lol. Definitely a kickass movie. I'll be watching it again soon for sure.",8
lastonegothaxxored,"I dunno why but that just bothered me, as someone who's spent time in Japan, and has many relatives there.

Anyway, that's all I had to say. I will now leave the lobby and go back to the theatre, since I stepped out to answer a phone call, and wound up writing a terrible movie review as well.

Im guessing this will be a 7.5-8, but I'm only like half an hour into this. Hope I'm right.

Ok I need more characters, so I'm back in the theater. This half Japanese looking girl is talking to Hiroyuki Sanada, who looks good as always. Dang he's handsome.

Alright no spoilers so far, but this is getting boring. I hope this picks ups soon, I'll change my review if it doesn't.",7

The ending was almost as bad as the last matrix movie. Everything else was fine as far as the storyline goes. How did you think people were going to feel about this/ or react. Like oh my gosh what a wonderful ending.... Now when everyone asks me how the movie was, all I can say is eh, it made me feel worthless at the end. Don't go see it in theater is what I'll say lol Hope it does well after all the bad reviews come out after opening.",8

pravsathi,"The movie is worth the wait. This movie franchise has set the bar really high for action movies and it is going to be a benchmark of sorts for the action movies of future. Keanu Reeves is amazing, as he has been in the first 3 installments. Donnie Yen is treat to watch and his action sequences are just mind blowing. The run time is a bit on the higher side but you will not feel that. The action seems a bit over the top at certain times but it does not last long. This movie franchise is making audience fall in love with close combat action and its good. Watch it in a good theater with proper sound and screen. The experience will be enhanced.",9
roadramblerever-05743,"With the sudden rash of mass shooting, murder , etc going on in our country today, this is one movie that shouldn't have been made. We got to many crazies dope addicts that will take this movie seriously and the next thing you know their out there trying to be John Wick. It was hard for me to even pretend this movie was good. Hundreds of trained fighters died and thousands of rounds were shot and John Wick being the one they were after never once took a bullet or sliced opened with a sword. Even getting hit by high speed cars about four times, he still walks away. Unrealistic Science fiction!!",2
blazedragon666,"From horse race to traffic fight to stair brawl, John Wick deliver what you'd expect from John Wick! The nods for movies like The Warriors and the John Wu movies were just perfect.

John Wick : Chapter 4 is a brilliant action movies with creativity, nice camera angle, a blood-soak adventure and so much more. This is possibly the best action movie since a long time. I can't recall the last time I went to the theater to see an action movie and oh boy was it worth my time!

My only negative point is that there's not enough action scene with Chidi (Marko Zaror who stared in Undisputed 3) and Killa (Scott Adkins from the same movie) who ate both talented in Martial Art. And for my personal, I would have take more of Hiroyuki Sanada!

All in all, John Wick : Chapter 4 is a must see movie!",10
csbnwyfrr,"Lets talk positives first; If you like action, and liked the first three movies especially for the action; you're in for a hell of a ride with this one. The action is superb, with shots and angles and stunts you have never seen before.

That's about it, yeaah

Lets talk negatives then; Keanu reeves, as sympathetic as he might be in person, deserves a golden raspberry for this performance. His dialogue fits onto less than one sheet of paper (in a 3 hour movie!!) from which half is just an overly dramatic >>yeaah<< or >>maybe<< which the other guests found to be funny while I found it odd, even ridiculous as it went on. His performance completely pulled me out of the immersion. Very unsatisfying.

The protagonist John Wick does literally nothing in this movie that regains our sympathy for him.

They just throw him in there and say >>that's the protagonist, go root for him<<, but I just had a hard time swallowing that pill which lead to me not having fun on his journey to get away from the table

On a different note, I already mentioned the inflated runtime of 170 minutes. This is at least 40 minutes too long! They could have completely get rid of Shamier Anderson's character and nothing would have changed about the outcome of the movie, which wasn't particularly bad but also not shocking, as it was rather poorly foreshadowed.

All in all, the action in this is world class, perhaps the best action in a movie ever, but as soon as the action was over, the fun was over as well.",5
ts-08627,"It was the best action movie I saw. I really congratulate all the actors of this movie. There were very difficult stunts in this movie, although it is said that Keanu did most of the stunts himself, but it is not believable. One of the wonders of this movie is its lighting. And it was very good that this four-part movie ended with all its excitement and the peace they considered for John was very appropriate and acceptable with all the hardships he went through and the people he lost along the way. I hope that if part 5 of this series is made, they will provide a very good and acceptable reason because it could not be better than this.",9
manugibert,"John Wick's character is increasingly invincible and loses credibility. It annoys me that he falls from high altitudes, gets hit and goes on like nothing; always attack him with pistols instead of machine guns or grenades that would be more effective to kill him. It doesn't have a plot almost, it's just one fight after another. Some transitions feel forced, the fights in the first half all feel the same and it gets a bit boring, only the ending escalates more. It is to see in the cinema, the sound design and the choreography are getting better and better; This one is more solid and closes better than the last two. But overrated on Imdb.",6

We want please again john and Caine friendship and story we again want biggest blast we again and again want next level action we again want a top class story all credit of story goes to the director and producers and story makers.,10
engmuhammadsaied,"3 scenes were the best action/fight scenes I have ever seen, and boy I have seen a lot!!

3rd place: the stairs fight ... it was done perfectly ... cameras placement and rotation was just amazing ...

2nd place: the Paris roundabout fight ... how did they think about this? I mean, the execution was simply unmatched ..

1st place: the bird-eye view fight in the old building (the best angle of a fight scene I have ever seen), it was like a 2D game from the top .. like the ones we used to play on old consoles but with today's technology, I have to say that this is the best way I have seen to shoot a fight scene!!

A perfect finale ... amazing job!!",9
homegrownfilms@yahoo.com,"I give this film a higher rating cuz it looked like a super complicated film to plan, direct, shoot, choreograph and edit. So I tip my hat to the professionals that made this, But there was so much gun fire, that it kinda got old after a while. I will say the driving scenes of Keanu and the overhead camera scene when he has that explosive gun were really amazing. I don't get the character with the vicious dog. It was so similar to Halle Berry's character. Were they supposed to be related? It seemed like a rehash to have a vicious k9 attack peoples crotches. Or maybe the greater of John Wick really loves K9's attacking people. But seemed odd to bring that back.

Killa was my favorite character. A fun character, good acting and fantastic fighting.",N/A
dharrypotter,"This Film is packed with great amount of action with a tiny punch of humor and remarkable storyline. There are lots of moments when the audience would spontaneously cheer up between the scenes. John Wick films have a great thing as it progresses with every sequel and Chapter 4 doesn't fail to do so, instead it's the summit of all 4 movies. The end of the film synchronize with perfect ending for great story. The screenplay, direction and scenes keep getting better and better throughout. As they say what makes action scene perfect is background music and the team has gone limitless to provide so with intense action music that won't let you blink your eyes. Overall it's a must watch movie for every fan as well as those who seek to enjoy action films.",10

Has received mixed reviews from critics. While some have praised the film's action sequences and the performances of its cast, others have criticized its length and lack of originality. The Guardian called it ""overlong and overstuffed,"" while The Verge described it as ""unrelenting in every sense."" However, The Hollywood Reporter called it a ""pure, over-the-top action spectacle,"" and Roger Ebert gave it a positive review, saying it ""outdoes its formidable predecessors in nearly every respect."" The New Yorker also gave it a positive review, calling it ""by far the best of the four films"" and praising its ""alluring and self-perpetuating mythology.""

Did I mention the movie is way too long we watched this in IMAX and my ears were hurting from the gun noise. The fighting scenes are pretty awesome and the scenery is nice, but I think good movie needs more than justice this. I wouldn't recommend to watch this at home and not in the theatre. You can have a break and adjust sound yourself.. I do hope there won't be a sequel for movies of the same character must be enough. Just make a video game of it.",3
ivanprlic-01245,"When I saw runtime of this movie I was really sceptic about it, I taught they gave them too much money to play with and oooh I was wrong. Everything in this movie works for me. Sets are bigger, runtime is bigger and ACTION is off the charts. Action scenes are amaizing and I said if you value it on action scenes it's the best ever. New characters are probably my favourite part of this movie. They gave so much, especially because John doesn't talk much. Only minus I have is one action scene on stairs too much and that's it. Color grading and sets are just perfect. All and all it was perfect ending for John Wick and I hope this is their last movie because how can you go bigger than this?",10
Kactus218,"The production value of the movie is phenomenal, everything about the coreographies, costume designs, lightning, make up and soundtrack is astonishing (could've been a better balance between volumes during the fight scenes but f it, irl gunshots would be obnoxiously loud too).

BUT the plot is unimaginative and predictable, whole narrations echo through the series, the outcome of every scene is predictable if not whole personal plots; the dialogues are shallow, almost as if they were thought up on the spot after hitting a j.

I have no other way to say it, this movie is simply boring.

After three other installations of the series, how long can we watch John (yeah) Wick decimating nameless lifes as is they were dandelions beholding a tornado?

Not to mention how probably an hour of landscapes and nobodies getting unalived could have been replaced by deeper introspection of the character, which put himself in quite the original predicament , and telling of his backstory (just showing a bunch of quirky assassins, telling their names and how long they've known each other without further explanation is just lazy).

AND THE END OF THE MOVIE, SWEET BBY JZS, HOW DISAPPOINTING JOHNNY BOY, YOU KILLED HUNDREDS OF MEN FOR NOTHING WHEN YOU COULD'VE JUST STOPPED AT THE GUY WHO KILLED YOUR DOG AND STOLE YOUR CAR.

YOU'RE GRIEVING, WE GET IT, BUT GOING ON A WORLDWIDE RAMPAGE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A HEALTHY COPING MECHANISM

This feature film has no balance.",5
rickbenyola,"Yes, it's John Wick. Fans here from the beginning. With that said, I believe the movie run time was just too long. I went with a group of 5 of all ages - 16 to 53. Everyone admitted they dozed off a few times - granted it was a 7:30 show and we got out at 10:30pm. Great actors, and a few new ones that added to the story. I won't spoil it, the one has a major disability that would make it impossible to pull off what he does in the movie. But... this is John Wick, Hollywood, special effects, and we all know John Wick, his Kevlar suit, unlimited ammo and moves... well, who can stop him? üòÉ if your a fan, go!

Glad to see they are making a fifth installment. Awesome sauce! I'm glad Keanu enjoys making them as much as we enjoy watching them. I love Morpheus as well lol..

vivihuangca,"The John Wick franchise was something I've never seen before. Glad I took a trip to the cinema, because this movie was absolutely mind-blowing. This film just kept on pumping adrenaline for the entire 3 hours runtime; there was one wide shot from the ceiling, where I watched John Wick absolutely obliterate 30 gunman with a modified shotgun. Donnie Yen's performance was excellent and way beyond my expectations. In this film, you can't find a single actor that didn't add to the adrenaline rush and didn't contribute to Wick being an absolute menace. The entire film is an action-packed feast, and an absolute blast. 10/10.

On the other hand, the film did render me confused with the introduction of High Table and relationships between Wick's friends. It made the plot development a bit too confusing for a new viewer of the franchise. Also, John Wick's death seemed way too sudden and led straight to the end. The film communicated a solid story, 7/10. Also, probably would've been higher if I had watched the other 3 films in the franchise before hand.

Overall, a thrilling, powerful, and one of the best action films that actually brings out the action.",8
jetset_funky,"John Wick 4, an American classic, presents a narrative filled with monotonous gunfire and battle sequences. The fight scenes that look stiff and weird, leave a boring impression. However, in the final moments of the film, in the midst of a gripping duel, the boredom dissipates, replaced by a surge of inexplicable visceral positivity.

This film immersed me in the adrenaline-pumping world of John Wick, a famous assassin played by Keanu Reeves. From the start, a distinctive action-packed film style was realized, serving as a hallmark of the franchise. The non-stop exchange of bullets and the ensuing battle between Wick and his opponent can feel repetitive, even if it's visually stunning. One might crave a refreshing diversion from this relentless onslaught.

However, it is precisely in the closing seconds of the film where John Wick 4 manages to go beyond the boundaries of a seemingly one-dimensional premise. The plot takes unexpected turns, uncovering underlying emotional depths that remain unexplored until the very end. It's this deep infusion of positive sentiment that sets this film apart from its predecessors and other similar action-oriented offerings.

Without digging into spoilers, the film manages to strike an elusive balance, combining the raw power of John Wick's combat prowess with revealing thoughts that resonate deeply with audiences. It's in these key moments that one's initial skepticism of the film's monotony fades, replaced by a sense of connection to the characters and their journeys.

In short, John Wick 4 is basically an American film that originally revolved around repetitive gunfights and stilted fight scenes. However, in its final moments, the film struck me with positive feelings and deep emotional resonance. It managed to transcend its own formulaic approach, leaving me with a deep connection to the characters and a new appreciation for the underlying message. Despite its flaws, John Wick 4 manages to deliver an engrossing and thought-provoking cinematic experience that ultimately makes it a worthy addition to the set.",8

macbethchisopa,"Of all the action movies I have watched over the years, there hasn't been one that has surpassed my expectations like John Wick. I swear I could watch it over and over again and not even get bored. The movie has intense fighting scenes that make skipping very impossible, and, to my surprise, it keeps getting better and better with every movie added to its trilogy. I'm sure, even after 50 years, the movie will still be spectacular to everyone who watches it. By the way, I think Chapter 4 would just have been 5 hours long because good movies like John Wick make 2 hours and 49 minutes seem really short. I loved everything about it.",10
codestar30,"The movie is almost 3 hours long and there's only 5 action sequences. The rest of the film is just either people talking about how they're going to kill John Wick or how they used to be friends with John Wick.

The action choreography could be good but I had a hard time telling as all the fights were so dimly lit that it was difficult to see what was happening.

But credit where credits is due: there is one very enjoyable set piece featuring a shotgun loaded with dragon breath rounds.

If you enjoyed John Wick 2 and 3 you might enjoy this. If you weren't already sold on the franchise this isn't the film that will change your mind.",5
tytheamerican,"To start, I feel like I should explain why I rated this movie so highly.

It's because I was laughing hysterically through half of the 2.5 hour long movie.

At no point in this movie did I feel like I was watching a traditional or even new age action thriller. It felt like a parody of John Wick movies. Granted it would have been a good parody if the movie were limited to a standard 1 hour 20 minute runtime, but it felt artificially prolonged.

It's a weak and tragic ending to the John Wick series. It's violence becomes inconsequential after a solid and insufferable 25 minute segment near the beginning. It's quirky avant garde settings are so absurd that it destroys any serious emotional moments that the plot tries to push on the audience.",5
siddharthshendge-24052,"The movie starts & ends well but gets saturated & boring with too much action & violence.

**SPOILER ALERT** The Japan's action sequence prolonged too much with armored men coming in small groups and John Wick killing all of them with the same boring shooting. Adding nunchucks only made the sequence better for a short span of time.

John falls of from 2-3 floors multiple times but not a single broken bone/drop of blood. Kinda ironic right.

I agree that the entire cities are controlled by mafias, but seriously, when John fights off hoards of goons & assassins at the end, not a single legal intervention from cops is shown.

Surprisingly there's not a drop of blood/broken bone when John falls off 222 stairs. Gotta be more practical in such sequences.

Overall, the direction, performance of the actors and storyline was good, but action slightly lacked practicality. Good popcorn flix & best time to escape from the harsh reality of life.",6
Tiddles2008,"This by itself is a pretty decent movie not as good as Chapter 2 but about as good as the other 2. However, the impression that I get from the first 3 John Wick movies is that he doesn't die and is incredibly skilled. In this though he dies after getting shot 3 times which he survives similar things in the other movies. Because of this it just feels like it was rushed and just missed the point of the rest of the franchise. The CGI was unimpressive but the last time I watched a new film it was Avatar: The Way Of Water so it might just be my expectations being set too high. On the bright side the extras were much better than in the previous films.",6
ikbenmercedesz,"I give an 8, because I love KR and the way how he plays John Wick.

However, that two points have been lost due to the fact, that this movie is just a video game John Wick.

Why?

Very easy to explain: In the first movies everything is in the real life, hidden from the innocent eyes. People are reacting normal if something is happening, but of course, I miss every time the police to show up.

In this movie is nothing real. Or at least they didn't even try to keep it in the real life. Not only the sound tracks give you a feeling of watching a demo of a video game, but the camera angles are also working on it.

Earlier you had dry jokes flying around. In this one is only the DOG who can make me laugh. One time.

John Wick is looking very bad in this film. Like, he wants to die, but first he has to make 3h - long - movie, before he can do it.

Honestly, I didn't rewatch JW 3, because I hoped, that I will get some indication what we are doing there. Nope. The old friends scene took me also a very long time to identify and recall why who what is doing. I hoped that I could see some rehabilitation of JW, but nothing. He is good again.

Oh yes, insane fantasy scene: JW has been smashed against the electricity poles and rolled back down the stairs. I couldn't breath because I thought that he will just lay down and will take minutes before he can recover and stay up from his blood.

WHERE IS THE BLOOD? My friend felt from 13m and he is now walking again, so I had ""experience"" with such a smash.

But no. JW is a GOD. Nothing can hurt him.

Also the scene in Berlin. What is that? Like a video game! It was made very good, but just like, this is not the normal JW movie?

And sorry, that radio girl who tried to talk sexy and mean gave me a where-is-my-skip10sec-button-feeling? She was aweful! Maybe if the camera had shown only her head or something, but like this way I could see what she has eaten between two records.

And if we are talking about teeth and unrealistic things: Those teeth of Winston! I am really the person who likes to look into the eye or face when somebody is talking, but by Winston, I was the whole time wondering if it is the filter or his ""real"" teeth :D

Anyway, the video game sound tracks I have in my pocket, John Wick is siting somewhere on an island, drinking his coctail, and yeah, don't leave the room until the last letter of the credits.... We were the ONLY one, who kept sitting there. And I am afraid that we will have a JW 5.",9
aaronguilmette,"If you enjoyed any of the other three, this is a non-stop roller coaster, amped up to 11. It features a lot of catchy and signature lines, delivered in a way that is both cool and cheesy.

The gun-fu is next level, and the addition of Donnie Yen contrasts Reeves's style so well.

It's over-the-top and exhausting, exhilarating and beautifully shot. It showcases the best of Wick's humanity. The cinematography is a cut above the previous entries in the series.

This is one of the few movie franchises that continues to defy expectations and delivers an experience well worth the price of admission.

Stay for the post-credits scene.",9
grazumic,"I haven't seen 1,2,3 so I don't know the whole story.

But I doubt it exists at all.

Actually it's not a movie, but a video game.

The only difference is that we don't play, we just watch.

Technically work is spectacular.

Everything else is nothing.

And finally a relief.

John Wick is buried.

Or is it not?

It depends on the earnings at the box office.

I will certainly not watch the fifth part.

Part with woman on the radio speaking about final fight and music with reference to The Warriors .

That music is not from the superior 21st century or the environment is the most common plagiarism.

For video games funs , must see.

For others , avoid and watch The Warriors.",3
saytomenicefeelz,"This is the movie I have waited for long and it didn't disappoint me. I think this movie is better than all john wick movies and some action movies, how it is better? This movie is funny than all previous john wick movies and action scenes is amazing (Cinematic,Production etc. Is also great). For sure this is a great movie but it is not good enough. Some scenes such as the Shimazu dying scene is not sad as the scene intended, because, this movie is a lot more action scene that make the story progression slower and make the movie longer and make it a little bit boring. [(8/10) my eng is bad lol)",8
rizoz2000,"This movie has, without doubt, some of the best action sequences ever put on screen. As a huge fan of the first 3 films, I didn't think the action could be topped, especially when compared to parabellum, but this film takes it to insane new heights. Of course you need to suspend disbelief into the statistical impossibility that john wick has somehow survived the onslaught of enemies, but who cares when it's this entertaining. The film uses lots of different styles and weapons and has some amazing setpieces but everything always feels real and in the moment... largely due to it mostly being real, with the actors and stuntmen giving it everything.

Action aside, I still think this is the best john wick film in terms of quality...keanu reeves is excellent as always but the film has a real weight to it and is brilliantly written and directed, with flashes of humour that dont feel forced, and stunning cinematography. The fact that the movie is nearly 3 hours long and doesn't drag for a second is a testament to how great it really is.

Overall, if this is the final John Wick film, the excellent franchise has went out at its absolute apex. The action is mind-blowing and never boring. If you loved the first 3 films, I doubt this one will be an exception, as its everything that made them great, and then some, dialed up to 11.

Rating: A+",10
nbalaschsola,"John Wick Chapter 4 offers stunning visuals and action-packed fight scenes, but ultimately falls short in terms of storytelling. The movie takes us on a thrilling journey through Japan and Paris, showcasing their unique beauty and culture. The fight scenes are expertly choreographed, and Keanu Reeves' performance as John Wick continues to impress.

However, the movie lacks depth and fails to inspire beyond its aesthetic appeal. The plot feels predictable and fails to introduce any new ideas or themes. While the action is impressive, it becomes repetitive and loses its impact as the movie progresses.

Overall, John Wick Chapter 4 is a visually stunning movie that delivers in terms of action, but lacks the substance to truly captivate and inspire its audience. If you're a fan of the franchise or looking for an entertaining action movie, this movie won't disappoint. However, if you're looking for a movie that will leave a lasting impression, John Wick Chapter 4 falls short.",N/A
ewankirkby,"While I don't generally rate more recent films higher as they haven't stood the test of time yet John Wick Chapter 4 is an exception. It has a far better story than parts 2 and 3 due to John having a more personal motivation for his typical antics. Chapter 4 also benefits from the best action sequences of the series, In parts 1, 2 and 3 there have to me only been one or two standout action scenes; the club fight in the first the entire Italy concert/catacombs sequence in the second and the Continental hotel siege in the third. John Wick 4 on the other hand has huge fight in a hotel in Osaka, a nightclub showdown blowing the one from the first out of the water and finally the final part of the film is literally non stop action around Paris In which there's a car chase around the arc de triomphe which quickly turns into a fight in which John throws people into the oncoming traffic, a Hotline Miami style top down shootout with and finally a long fight up a tall staircase. The fourth chapter of the franchise also has the best supporting cast since the original including a brilliant Donnie Yen and the series best villain in Bill Skarsgard. Overall a near perfect all out action film.

Final Rating 9.0/10

Also make sure to stay until the very end because of there is an important post credit scene.",9
hematmmh,"The total review of the film would be interesting.

The start was good, the flow of movie was fast enough and the ending was unexpected and beautiful. Both happy and sad about the finish, sad that we wouldn't have another John wick and happy that they didn't extend it anymore, it would be spoiled.

I have a criticism about the scenes in the square which many cars drove by and a lot of fighting was happening. Those scenes seemed very artificial and I couldn't connect with them, I supposed they could be executed much better and in more natural fashion like we've seen in previous John wicks.

All in all, thank you. John wick franchise is one of my favorites and I always love it.",8
demetriodacosta,"John Wick 4 is to action cinema what the Sistine Chapel is to Italian Renaissance painting.

A bombastic feast for all senses. As long as you check your common sense at the door of the movie theater.

Seeing how the quality of movie franchises typically fizzles out with each sequel, it is great to see how the creators of John Wick have found ways of upping the ante every time. What could they possibly do in John Wick 5 to top what has been done here? My imagination does not extend so far. Maybe bring Khabib Nurmagomedov as one of John's nemeses?

But if you are looking any kind of realism, character depth and development, like some people here who gave this film low ratings, then you are following the wrong franchise.",10
charmcitycombatives,"One of the most imaginative action movies ever made, in a series of extremely well-crafted action films. Of course the set-up and situations are ridiculous, but the kinetic, deadly ballet is incredibly well-choreographed and artistically filmed - and that's the real draw. This film manages to continue to expand the neo-noir underworld milieu of the series without sacrificing any of the mystery. It also manages to increase the stakes for the characters. And while it draws the series to a satisfying conclusion, it also manages to leave room for more adventures in a setting ripe for stories and stunts. Truly a tour de force!",10

Not for one second was I averted from the movie, it was that captivating! If you haven't watched it yet, then trust me your money won't go to waste purchasing a ticket for this movie! Go Watch!

One of the things I also cherished was that the ending was very realistic, given that John Wick died, I believe it gave it a very remarkable and mature ending to be honest.

In all, saying that this was a superb movie is an understatement!",10
hosseinbidelhb,"John Wick Chapter 4 is the best action movie I have seen, this movie is full of pure adrenaline, in my opinion the best action movie ever. A detailed script with attractive and charismatic characters.decoupage to the extent of the story, fantastic cinematography, fluent and first-class direction, Chad Stahelski has improved from film to film and these are fantastic. Keanu Reeves knows what he is doing, he knows what he is doing and he has digested the character of John Wick in himself, he gave a wonderful performance, he is the best, the best.

kamleshgurjar-86344,"Hands down, it is the best modern action movie of all time. Keanu Rocks !! He is so sick in it. Baba Yaga is king of modern action movies. Keanu's dedication and commitment can be clearly felt on the screen. Its more than a movie it's emotion . Love for Keanu And Franchise has even increased more. Kudos to Keanu,Chad and team for showing us what true action is. The whole cast is full of talented actors. Keanu is unparalleled. Its compelling to watch him on the screen. The action is very organic. The movie is very well written. It is full of emotions. It is pure cinema. Bill Skarsgard as the antagonist is too good. He blews up when he comes on the screen. He has added depth to movie. Without him it would not have been this much fun. Hats off to him. The way he talks, walks and his accent are so cool and to the point. Killed it !I admire him for his Donnie Yen as the blind man was crazy good. Hiroyuki Sanada and Akira are on another level. The action is so slick. Keanu And Scott Adkins Fight is so good in terms of music,cinematography and Visuals. T he background score and music is too good. It intensifies the emotions and elevates action sequences to another level. The music adds depth to the movie. Its a masterpiece. My love for the franchise and Keanu has even increased more ! Love you Keanu Reeves !!",10
imperitrix,"When people discuss this movie they single out Keanu and Donnie Yen, and rightfully so. Yen is a revelation in his role and Keanu has his character down pat, but let's give a little love to the supporting players. Hiroyuki Sanada brings his patented gravitas to his role as the manager of the Osaka Continental. Scott Adkins is both funny and badass in his fat suit. Shamier Anderson (and his dog) add a humorous touch to the proceedings. Lance Reddick (RIP), in a small role is very good and Ian McShane does his usual stand up performance. Other characters like Hiroyuki Sanada's daughter and the guy who plays the Marquis' bodyguard are very good, too. This is one of the best acted action movies ever.",8
anonymousboss-90622,"Unfortunately, as great as the plot is, as great as the fight scenes are, as great as the cast is, there is one major problem! That is Keanu Reeves. He is the worst actor I have had the displeasure to watch. He speaks like a robot. How is it possible for an actor to be so bad at acting.

As much as the fight scenes were really cool. The acting just ruins it. I also didn't like how he seems invincible. They made him overpowered which seems ridiculous

If Keanu Reaves was replaced with someone better, this movie would be easily 8/10.

In conclusion, the movie is not boring because the plot is excellent. But the acting ruins it.",6

The scenes using the gun that sets target alight is genius, the dog scenes are brilliant too. This is a sequel of the highest order.",9

jgsmith-92332,"After the first film ended, it was clear to me that the filmmakers had done something special. Upon the ending of the 4th installment, I can say with confidence that this is likely the best action movie ever made. I stray away from action movies due to overused tropes, abundant cgi, and weak characters. This franchise breaks the mold, and gives us well thought out characters that we CARE about. Its ideas are fresh and exciting. The cinematography here may get Oscar- nominated. The fight choreography is simply the best in the business.

Aside from Wick taking some unrealistic falls and brushing them off as only a bruise, I was wholly engrossed in # 4 for its almost 3 hour run time. If you're like me and don't bother going to the movies for action pics, do yourself a favor. Find the most extravagant screen you can, and go see this film in theaters. This is what they were made for.",10
pantstco,"Where do I begin?

I'm writing this review after watching the movie two times in 2 days. The first time I had to watch it dubbed (hoesnt mistake, I was I a rush) so it only made sense to me that I had to watch it again in English.

Firstly, the movie is really well shot. All the set pieces look absolutely stunning. Since most of the movie takes place at night, or indoors, the cinematographer had a field day and goes all out with the lighting.

If you have played the Devolver's Hotline Miami, you will LOVE this movie. There is one scene in the final act of the film that will give you goosebumps.

All in all it's a great watch especially if you loved the first 3 movies. If you don't like action movies or the franchise in the first place, I recommend you not to go and watch it lest the experience makes you write embarrassing 1 star reviews on IMDB lol.",10

Not much on the dialogue for this one, but it provides just enough juice there to give some substance outside of the choreographed fights and shots to the head.

Grab your pop corn, get the snacks, turn up the volume, lean back and enjoy. You are in for a ride. Happy hunting!",8

There are a few things I would have changed but all in all it worked. There was a slight blip in the editing job when the cinematic color changed from green to a more vivid color. Of coarse the stunts were sensational and outrageous but that is what makes the movie so thrilling! The best actor in the movie was the animal. Type of animal left out for the viewers to imagine. Go see it y'all! It put the biggest smile on my face!!!,9
Thy_lobowatcher,"Overall thought. John wick chapter 4 has everything. The buildup, the climax, the world building and set pieces just *Chef's kiss*. And best of all nonstop action. Lets get to the pros and cons shall we?

PROS: The world of john wick. I love how after close to 10 years as soon as it starts you are brought into this underground world of assassins and you are an expert of it. Respect to the writers and director of placing you in this world and not being jarred by it. Kind of Similar to harry potter you can easily go in and out anf cherish being in it. Such great fashion and this colorful but dangerous artistic ambience.

The characters. Each supporting characters can have their own movie. They can be as limited of a screentime as 5 minutes and still want to know more but also not want them to get harmed. Standouts are Donnie yen and Anderson as the tracker. I mean scott adkins was unrecognizable and stood out as well.

The story. It is crazy to believe that this all started with a revenge story and became a fight about freedom and the will to live.

Last but not least. The action sequences. The action has set such a bar that any movie with those bad editing cuts will automatically get a failure from me. If you dont got half of john wick type action i wont even enjoy your movie. Such memorable moments. That nunchucks sequence and dragon breathe fight!!.

CONS. Hard to find cons but best i can say is the ending can be divided by many. The movie can be a tad bit long for some but i do think they are vital to the story.",9
honeycloudt,"I've been a fan of this franchise since the first movie came out, along with my mum (who I went to see it with) I'm only 17 years old as of now, but I just appreciate the amazing time and effort it takes to create these beautiful movies. The director has just gotten better and better with cinematography, offering us just tear-welling beautiful scenes accompanied by sophisticated yet hardcore badass fights that need a lot of effort and training for. The locations and lighting... just wow. I was worried at first about all of the new characters introduced but I fell in love with them not long after. Caine is an amazing character who is an amazing fighter showing strength with a disability. I also love Killa and his fight with John, the music, scenery and the fight was just jaw dropping. Huge props to Le Castle Vania for the pumping music with these scenes, and the use of the music from the first film in that dynamically directed *dragons breath* scene was just everything I ever wanted. I must say this movie is like... the aesthetic of my soul, and will live on in my heart, it inspires me in my studies as I do character design, art and photography. Thank u Chad. And Rest in peace to Lance Reddick, it's good to see you one last time in this film. Fly high.",10
TheOfficialShocker,"Very good movie, a bit sad ending. Keanu Reaves is a good actor I really like how he plays. The choice of backing tracks and shots was excellent, I also really liked the references to previous films such as the pencil scene or the dog scene.

The ending is a bit sad but that's okay sometimes ""pulling"" a series of films with too many sequels risks ruining the story, I'm confident in a continuation of the series perhaps from the point of view of the girl daughter of the owner of the continental friend of wick.

The scene I liked the most is the shootout in the house with an overhead view that ends with Wick protecting the dog.

Summary: +nice movie +nice acting +nice backing tracks +nice shots
a bit too long
kinda sad ending...",9

However this new chapter on the John Wick saga takes you into a new dimension of action. Some of these action sequences are very original, you can note a hard work to make a difference respect other action movies. The electronic soundtrack is an excellent complement for the action. I recommend to see the movie in a IMAX cinema, this way you'll experience all the action details and the amazing sound. I usually see movies on IMAX and I call tell you the John Wick sound is absolutely amazing respect others movie in the same format.",10

Well now this John Wick Chapter 4 is definitely going to set a big record.

horexiv,"This thing is a powerhouse in the action genre. Directed by Chad Stahelski and starring the one-face-to-rull-them-all Keanu Reeves, the film delivers an electrifying experience from the very first shot. One of the film's most impressive aspects is its action sequences, this thing DOESN'T HOLD BACK, the fight choreography is a work of art, expertly crafted and executed with precision,handcrafted by a stuntman himself, and that just about shows up every time there's punches in the frame, showcasing a keen eye for detail.

Also to my surprise, the film weaves a compelling narrative as it delves deeper into Wick's character, exploring the emotional toll of his violent lifestyle adding further depth to the world of assassination while also conveying the internal struggle of a haunted and determined Reeves.

As for the visuals this is a feast for the eyes that captures the gritty underworld in all its dark and atmospheric setting, boosted by a sleek production design making each frame a work of art.

This thing sets a new benchmark for the action genre, exceeding expecationts at every turn.... you should watch it.",9

Once again, Keanu shows that he is one of the greatest of all the time, not sure if he has so many doubles, but definitely a giant on action scenes, impossible to not love that guy.

Also, the movie scenarios are extremely beautiful.

I am not a fan of action movies but this is one of the bests.",8
abdulhameedhamza,"Pure adrenaline, loved it absolutely from start to end. This has to be my all time favourite action movie. I loved the fact the there is no vulgarity or any unwanted sexual reference. Absolute thrill and a must watch for Action Movie fans. A make believe world full of hitmans with their set of rules, morals and principles.

Was there for KEANU REEVES and didn't disappoint either and to maintain the robustness and freshness in the 4th Installment says a lot about the whole team including director Chad.

Fantsatic BGM and action pieces and last not the least the Radio Jockey spin on the final chase sequence.

""FANTASTIC""",9
purplemania-339-801099,"I liked the other John Wick's. This one was over the top ridiculous. From the blind man that was somehow a better swordsman than everyone and a better shot than everyone to the fat guy that somehow could fight like chuck norris... The movie is about 2:45 with at least 2:15 of that time gun fights at close range where everyone gets hit but no one seems to die.

Yes, I realize it's a movie but the unrealistic activities are way too much.. seems more like a version of the animated Batman show from the 70's where the bad guys just keep coming out.... Over and over again...

Super explosive fight scenes but no plot whatsoever... very disappointed. I paid $20 for this crap.",2
delvinarnold,"Donnie has gone an excellent act of a disabled assassin that battled every fight. He shall be nominated for Oscar Best Supporting Actor! No questions!

Why? He proved to be a best assassin in hardships like he can do anything except see. He excelled in the martial art fights. The character of Caine applied to the biblical example of being a sinner so Donnie has done an excellent job of being good guy and bad guy in Marquis's expectations.

Donnie also done excellent acting as the disabled assassin in the mob world and challenged John Wick, Caine's friend into the battle. Caine beat everyone include John Wick. Donnie is a winner in Oscar nomination!",10
wzqjoker,"Keanu Reeves is beautiful he is my wife. (love love)and the action scene is cool. Great shot and beautiful scene changes. If we just talk about actors and shots is nearly perfect. BUT!!!!!! The plot is xxxx. I don't know how families is and I don't know how so call table is. And why they fight, fight for what? Power fight between families and table?(like politics fight)? I don't know, that makes no sense at all. Btw, 1,2 and 3 is fresh in action movies and make me feel new, with a almost clear outline of plot. 4 as the end is ok, a end with ""who knows"" but may be happy ending. But if 4 is a single movie, it's failed.",4
aaron_braswell,"If you only want action, the film is great. But this series had its best plots and character development in previous installments. The beginning of the movie was good, but it eventually turned into the constant fight scenes that we have all come to expect. Maybe I was hoping for a little creativity in story development, and i certainly thought the ending was unfair to viewers that have a vested interest in their hero. I left the theater surprised and annoyed.

The action scenes are done well. At times, I would laugh, other times I would cringe and sometimes I would do both. The new characters in the film were solid additions. And had meaningful roles. The settings and cinematography was also good. However, I kept thinking ""they are just trying to one up John Wick 3"". After a while I got board of it. And I rode that wave of boredom until the end, where I was flustered when I concluded this was the end of Mr. Wick.",5
shassankhan-69959,"John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers another thrilling and action-packed ride that is sure to please fans of the franchise. Directed by Chad Stahelski and starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, this latest installment picks up where the previous film left off and takes the audience on a journey filled with intense fight scenes, high-stakes drama, and breathtaking visuals.

The story picks up with John Wick on the run after being declared excommunicado by the High Table, the shadowy organization that governs the world of assassins. With a $14 million bounty on his head, Wick must use all his skills and cunning to survive and take down his enemies. Along the way, he reunites with old allies and makes new ones, including Sofia (Halle Berry), a fellow assassin with her own set of skills and demons.

One of the standout features of the John Wick franchise is its use of action sequences to drive the plot forward. The fight scenes in Chapter 4 are no exception and are some of the most impressive and inventive in the series. From a motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris to a brutal battle in a subway station, each set-piece is expertly choreographed and executed, showcasing the talents of the actors and stunt performers. It's clear that the filmmakers have a deep respect for the craft of action filmmaking and are committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

But John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't just about the action. The film also delves deeper into the mythology and world-building of the franchise. We learn more about the High Table and its inner workings, as well as the motivations and backstories of some of the key characters. There are also some surprising twists and turns that keep the audience guessing and add new layers of complexity to the narrative.

Of course, no review of a John Wick film would be complete without mentioning the performance of Keanu Reeves. Reeves has always been a charismatic and likable actor, but in this role, he truly shines. He brings a sense of world-weary gravitas to the character of John Wick, and his physicality and commitment to the role are evident in every scene. Reeves is also surrounded by a talented supporting cast, including Halle Berry, Ian McShane, and Laurence Fishburne, who all bring their own unique energy and flair to their respective roles.

Another standout aspect of John Wick: Chapter 4 is its visuals. The film is shot by veteran cinematographer Dan Laustsen, who has worked on previous installments in the franchise as well as other visually stunning films like The Shape of Water. Laustsen's use of color and composition is breathtaking, and he brings a sense of style and elegance to the proceedings that elevates the material beyond typical action movie fare.

In conclusion, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a thrilling and satisfying addition to the franchise. It's clear that the filmmakers have a deep respect for the craft of action filmmaking and are committed to delivering an experience that is both thrilling and emotionally engaging. With its impressive action sequences, deepening mythology, and strong performances, this latest installment is sure to please fans of the series and newcomers alike.",9
nicfernando,"This franchise has captured the lure of such a pretentious bunch of old men watching in awe a character we all love. This chapter was everything I expected from start to finish, reeves just grew into this role and it suits his style of acting, was so disappointed when the film ended especially how it ended, no spoilers but I felt every tumble John wick makes on that climb to the church holding my crutch. The story is a deliberate ploy to make you feel when you leave the cinema is that is the final chapter or if the story thickens to a more unexpected journey for Mr Wick. The writing of this film hits all the notes and it's worth entry fee.",9
rr-43085,"Anything that you do is everything Consequences Without rules we're animals All distilled down

Wow, wow, wow! What a movie. The Best Action Movie Ever!!!. One of the Best Movies Ever Made .Afraid to say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is perfect and a masterpiece in every aspect. This movie proves everyone wrong. I can proudly say that this is the best action movie i have ever seen on the big screen. Nothing can be compared to it.. must watch movie..Keanu Reeves' exceptional performance takes the action sequences to an entirely new level, making for a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. The Best Action Movie Ever!!!. One of the Best Movies Ever Made .",10
eerymithun,"By now anyone watching a John Wick movie must know what to expect. And boy does this movie deliver. The action sequences are a joy to watch mostly because the shots are long, minimum cuts, and fabulous choreography overall. It was shockingly amazing to see Keanu drifting the car himself while picking up his gun from the road, and many more consecutive car stunts in single shots were very refreshing to see. The story was linear but still reasonably engaging.

Just like the first movie, this movie also has a dog as plot point. I can't say more about it without giving out spoilers. To sum up, I would like to say that this movie can be set as the benchmark for modern action movies. Unlike those Liam Neeson flicks where nobody knows for sure what's going on due to hose excessive cuts in editing, this movie delivered pure satisfaction in its action scenes. Isn't it what everyone seeks in an action movie?",9
pample-38682,"There are no words to describe the fourth installment of this epic saga. The cast, the dialogue (or the lack of it!), the action scenes and various backdrops that really set the scene for the conclusion of this blockbuster. I literally reached nirvana when I saw Keanu pull out his gun for the 600th time to shoot the bad guys. I can't recommend it enough! It certainly is the best action film I've ever seen, and I've seen many, as I don't have other hobbies or interests in my life. Don't call me a loser, I rather you refer to me as a fan. It's a no brainer movie guys and you know what ? I like it a lot, thinking about the tattoo now.....",9
elebrond,"In my opinion, John Wick 4 is just the continuation to John Wick 3. It doesn't bring anything new to the table. Yes, it has good action sequences, but no better than the action sequences of the previous 3 movies.

As for the story, it makes no sense. The characters don't make sense. Not to mention making John Wick practically bulletproof.

I expected something better, something different, not the same from the 3rd part. I was expecting a big end.

That's not the way to end one of the greatest action characters ever created. Well, the truth is that this movie does not show the end of the story, only the end of the main character.",5
Khan_122814,"The action of the movie is very fast and feels realistic. Hope it will be better in the future. I really love action movies so I really enjoyed watching the trailer of this movie. I hope the full movie will be very beautiful.

John Wick: Chapter 4 The movie seems much better than the previous movies. So my personal opinion is that you all can watch the movie and enjoy it. This movie will prove a new genre of action. I hope you will like the story of the movie.

However, the comment I made is entirely my personal opinion. If you watch the movie, you may feel both good and bad.

I urge everyone to watch the movie.

Thank you very much to the Director for giving me such a beautiful movie.",7
verissimopt,"We don't see much of this type of movies nowadays, witch it sad in my opinion. My review is merely to give thanks to all the crew, the production team, the actors, Mr. Scott Adkins and of course Mr. Keanu Reeves, for creating a little bit of a fun time and entertainment, that we all need more than never right now. I give a 9 a not a 10 because a 10 for me is a perfect score and i don't believe in absolute perfection. Everything and everyone has flaws. Cinema is changing is core and in my opinion the entertainment is became a secondary goal to the Majorite of companies, its a shame because that is what i search the most when i go to the cinema. Thank you.",9
shyamgautam-07737,Absolutely entertaining and Best of the best action movie ever made. Non-Stop action totally worth money. There is no any minutes that you fell board. If you have high expectations for this movie that you won't be disappointed you gonna love it. I think this is the movie best action movie ever made so till the date. I had little expectations for this movie but it actually surprised me and there is not single minute that I don't feel bored since the beginning of this movie. This movie will surely make $1B box office I absolutely love this movie I don't usually like movie that early but is one is dope.,10
sielkeneumann,"This part of John Wick was hands down the best. I enjoyed it very much For both the plot and the choreography of the fight scenes (as always <3). That's what i love about john wick - brilliant fight scenes. Although there were of course some impossible events and again john wick survived by falling from the third floor or being hit twenty times by a car traveling at 80 km/h but it was still a very enjoyable movie. The actors did a great job especially Bill Skarsg√•rd (Marquise) and Donnie Yen (Caine). Also inconsolable Lance Reddick and Ian McSane were fantastic as always The movie was really great, I recommend it!!!",9
TiffanyMStockstill,"Watching John Wick Chapter now in theaters and its going into 3 Hours and ending...

Here's my review:

While the scenes and staging are pretty impressive, the drag out time for the film is not.

Its mostly fighting scenes, not like the originals where there was depth.

Places they ""shot"" (pun intended lol) the movie and the design is 10 stars.

The movie itself is decent but directors should of cut the time down.

If someone is into this much battling they would be at home gaming ...

Would recommend if you don't game, completely free, and don't mind sitting in theaters for over 3 hours.

Not sure why movies are becoming longer and longer but they are including the new John Wick.

Best concept is brotherhood. The ending is worth the long drawn out timing from fight scenes. A new character is introduced and I'm betting this is just the beginning of a super hero style series in decades to come like X-Men.",8
JohnCinema2022,"The first 3 movies were setting the lore with new elements. First movie, you learn about John Wick. Second movie, you discover the Continental and all it's implication. Third movie, you learn about the high table, their hierarchy, John's origin etc.

The 4th movie feels empty in term of new ideas. Basically, they just bring another high-graded goon sent by the table, just like the judicator in chapter 3.

They also bring back the concept of the assassin that uses dog to fight.

Finally, the whole part were John seeks asylum in his family and got his ticket cancelled is all reversed already.

Otherwise, the movie is great. Intense action, touching tribute to Lance Reddick and the ftop-view fight scene are really well done.",8
jasmin-wilhelmsen2,"Honestly, i enjoyed it a lot. I wasn't overly fond of the 2nd and 3rd movies because they felt a bit repetitive and predictable, this 4th one might actually be the best John Wick movie. The ""John Wick-verse"" keeps expanding, and i really enjoyed the worldbuilding. It felt like there was a more proper storyline, which was a nice change.

I did have one major issue though, and if it wasn't for that i would have LOVED THIS MOVIE . Unfortunately there was 1 MAJOR ISSUE. It made it really weird to watch, and did take me out of the experience. This movie doesn't even pass THE BECHDALE TEST and that is a LOW. BAR.

If it had been the other way around, and the director forgot there are actually more than 1 man per 100th woman i'm certain there would be comments about it everywhere.

Other than the fact that the movie seem to have a hard time realising that the distribution of men and women is about 50:50, there were a number of things that i really liked,

I really love some good action choreography and stunts, and letting Donnie Yen do his thing- both choreographing and doing action/stunts really was the best part of the movie. Keanu Reeves and his stunt double sure does their best, but it doesn't really compare to the speed and precision of a lifelong martial artist. I'd absolutely watch a spin-off based around ""Cane"".

Additionally, it was enjoyable on a purely aesthetic level. Locations colors and the framing of the shots were well executed, and i loved it. Additionally the music choices were good, fitting the vibe and really enhanced the ""story"".",7
p-88453,"The madness of series is increasing in every minute.

I have given 10 out of 10 stars to John Wick: Chapter 4, the latest installment in the action-packed franchise starring Keanu Reeves as the legendary assassin. Here is my spoiler-free positive review of the film.

John Wick: Chapter 4 is a thrilling ride from start to finish, with breathtaking stunts, exhilarating fights, and stunning cinematography. The film picks up where John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum left off, with John on the run from the High Table, the ruthless organization that rules the underworld. John teams up with the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), his old friend Caine (Donnie Yen), and a mysterious newcomer Akira (Rina Sawayama) to take down the High Table and its allies, including the Marquis (Bill Skarsg√•rd), a sadistic High Table member who wants John dead.

The film is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has helmed all the previous John Wick films, and he delivers another masterpiece of action filmmaking. The film is full of inventive and creative set pieces, such as a car chase through Paris, a sword fight on a bullet train in Japan, and a showdown in a neon-lit nightclub in Berlin. The film also pays homage to various genres and influences, such as martial arts, westerns, spy thrillers, and comic books. The film has a distinct visual style, with vibrant colors, sleek costumes, and dynamic camera work.

The film also boasts an impressive cast of actors who bring their characters to life with charisma and skill. Keanu Reeves is phenomenal as John Wick, showing his range of emotions, physicality, and intensity. He performs most of his own stunts and fights, which adds to the realism and authenticity of the film. Donnie Yen is a great addition to the franchise, as he showcases his martial arts prowess and chemistry with Reeves. Rina Sawayama is a revelation as Akira, a mysterious and badass female character who has her own agenda. Bill Skarsg√•rd is terrifying as the Marquis, a twisted and ruthless villain who enjoys torturing his enemies. The film also features returning favorites such as Ian McShane as Winston, Lance Reddick as Charon, and Hiroyuki Sanada as Shimazu.

John Wick: Chapter 4 is a must-watch for fans of action films and the John Wick franchise. It is a satisfying conclusion to John's story arc, while also leaving room for more adventures in the future. It is one of the best films of 2023 and deserves all the praise and accolades it has received.",10
ianlawrenceuk,"If John Wick was a lover, not a fighter, that would've been the most graphic porno of all time.

Though not a bad film, it feels like it overstays it's welcome. I found myself getting quite restless towards the end. It was a marathon to get through. So many, albeit well choreographed and unique action set pieces, were quite exhausting by the finale. Perhaps this was intentional, but is a long slog to get through and not to everyone's taste. I feel the film could've been edited significantly and a coherent and progressive narrative could still be established. It was akin to watching a post release directors cut. Good but needs a trim.",6
cool_nightmare-53202,"Amazing movie overall. Gets too slow in the beginning, but as story proceeds, John Wick gets into the action. Best cinematography and action sequences. Also, locations and ambience in the movie were really good. The tone of the movie was serious business. Unlike other John Wick chapters this one contains some funny parts, which is a plus. Background music is just same as the others, and really suits to the style and action. Best chapter in all JW series and it is a must watch.

Also, this JW chapter does travel across multiple nations and involves different characters from different ethinics :)",9
Jeremy_The_Legend,"John Wick 4 is a masterpiece of a movie that leaves no room for disappointment. The movie is a perfect example of what a true action film should be, with amazing fight scenes, excellent cinematography, and a breathtaking soundtrack. From start to finish, John Wick 4 delivers an unforgettable experience that is not to be missed.

Let's start with the fight scenes. The choreography and execution are so precise that it's hard not to get completely immersed in the action. Whether it's hand-to-hand combat or gunfights, John Wick 4 does not hold back, and every scene is a thrill ride. The fight scenes are so well-shot that you can feel every punch, every kick, and every gunshot. It's a testament to the incredible talent of the stunt team and the director.

The cinematography is equally impressive. The use of lighting, camera angles, and color palettes is nothing short of stunning. Every shot is beautifully framed and has a purpose. The movie looks like a work of art, and you can tell that every frame was carefully thought out and crafted.

The soundtrack is also worth mentioning. The music is epic and perfectly complements the action on screen. It's intense, emotional, and exhilarating all at the same time. The score is so good that you can't help but feel pumped up and ready for anything.

The non-stop action is what really sets John Wick 4 apart from other action movies. From the very beginning, the movie hits the ground running and never lets up. There's never a dull moment, and the pacing is perfect. It's a testament to the director's skill that he was able to keep the action going for the entire runtime without ever feeling repetitive or stale.

And let's not forget about Keanu Reeves. His performance is intense, emotional, and captivating. He brings a level of depth to the character that is rarely seen in action movies. You can feel his pain, his determination, and his resolve in every scene. It's a masterclass in acting, and Keanu Reeves deserves all the praise he's been getting.

John Wick 4 is a phenomenal movie that deserves all the praise it's been receiving. The fight scenes are breathtaking, the cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack is epic, and the non-stop action is thrilling. And with Keanu Reeves delivering one of his best performances ever, it's a movie that shouldn't be missed. If you're a fan of action movies, you owe it to yourself to see John Wick 4.",10

paulekleonardo,"John Wick 4 is a very good movie, the action is there, especially after so many CGI blockbusters, I didnt feel that since Top Gun Maverick, its so good to see real people doing stuff, and jumping and fighting, and not CGI monsters. The locations are pretty good, I guess sometimes we could notice some green screen, like in one portion of the movie where theres cars in a circle.. and at the end, it would be more cool if it were filmed in a real location with real lightning. But the movie us very cool, when its not showing new characters that dont develop too much, or they want you to care about them more than you really care.

When it comes to writing and dialogs I feel that this movie is very, very generic, my favorite is 3 cuz its just an action movie with enough dialog and lots of shooting, this one has more talking than action and i felt bored a lot, cuz everything is a cliche, Keanu barely has lines, and thats the bad part of the movie, all the talking. But I understand thats cuz this one is a goodbye from Wick,or maybe not.

Another thing that bothered me was the Kevlar suit, that everyone has, even the assassins that are not wearing a suit have kevlar clothes, that really bothered me, sometimes I could notice people getting shoot at the head ( bald guys ) and the bullet just ricocheting, thats was weird.. I feel that in this movie Keanu is superman, nothing touches him, he can fall from 4-5 floors and nothing happens, and in the previous movies Wick was not superman, he didnt have powers or anything like that, thats a bad thing too, cuz I didnt feel the stakes.

I didnt like the blind man, a blind man is a insane killer in a world with snipers? Yeah right.. but thats it.

The best action part for me was the dragon breath and nightclub.",8
tommyjp-75964,"All the john wick films are incredible, but none are as good as this one. From the action that is so iconic to this franchise, to the incredible music score, and of course the incredible characters.

The action in this film is insane. I don't think we have seen any film as action packed as this one. Clocking in at 2hr54min this movie is very long. And you kind of feel that while watching. But the way they plant 10 minute long fight scenes keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.

The music in this movie is a game changer for this movie. Because of the music the action scenes and other scenes as well are on another level. The cyberpunk esc beats is fantastic. Love the credit song.

This movie is a must see and definitely rounds the franchise off fantastically.",9
jw-63198,"I would like to say is there any movie which can compact with John wick?? I doubt that well its because of two reasons one the director of this movie Chad .. ufff perhaps the best and second.. well should I give into to this man... naah the one and only Keanu Reeves.. he is the best ever can't imagine John wick doing by other actor... no never only Keanu can he is the best... the way he is doing martial arts.. just mind blowing... he is not a martial arts he learned for this movie.. but the amount of acting he has put is just mind blowing.

He is what he is as always... Want to see more of his action film in future.. and about movie I'm not going much into .. just go and watch it in theater only.. cause that I it you will get to know how they made this kind of film.. so don't wait go to theater watch it .",10
LKD17,"Spoilers: I understand that the saga had to end at some point, but that doesn't mean Wick had to die. People say that in order for wick to truly find peace and freedom he had to be dead. I find it is absurd to believe that in order to find peace we have to die, death is not the answer. Killing wick to give him peace, is like saying everyone who has loss a loved one will not find peace until they die....that is false! Pain hurts but we eventually find a way and life goes on. We wish a happy life to those who we love, John's wife probably thought the same. She would have wanted a John Wick who left all the past behind and found meaning in his new life without her. Instead, the writers didn't give wick time for closure and to fully overcome his grief for her. It was just killing, killing, killing until he died too. At least they should have made wick's death a mystery like the dark knight rises. I truly hope this was not the end for such an incredible character.",7
stuartgreen-23715,"Just back from an imax viewing. Admittedly not the biggest action fan but this is undoubtedly has some of the best action scenes I've ever seen, the part around the Arc de triomphe especially had me smiling and gasping.

Obviously the whole thing is over the top and far fetched and it's a tough knowing how far to push it with giving the viewers what they want but not be such BS that it's off putting. Well unfortunately with this Caine character I just couldn't get into it, for a blind guy to be doing what he was doing throughout the movie in what was very much a main role was just too ridiculous and ruined the whole movie for me. I can see why it's getting the plaudits it is from fans, but reminded me of that one episode of that 'See' that I watched before I shouted BS and switched it off.",7
storiesandseries,"Anything that you do is everything Consequences Without rules we're animals All distilled down

-no spoilers-

Classic John Wick in the masterpiece Awesomesphere!

#4 is the bestest of the series in all areas.

Neon lights, glass and mirror combat fights, mano a mano fights, bow and arrow, car chases, and some puppy love.

Punchy and Clever and a touch of wicked humor.

Nothing was left out in this promises made and promises kept sequel.

For sure, one can enjoy this without seeing the first 3, bc the mystique and narrative are just right. The rhythm and rhyme is impeccable. It's so simple and clear in its own pretenses that unless you understand the genre you just won't get it. As smart and zany as the original TV Batman and the original Star Trek.

Pummel perfection.

Tokyo, New York City, Berlin, Sahara Desert, Paris...candle lit sunlit, neon lights...the cinematography is brilliant. And the stunt work is pure brilliancy and exhilarating.

The layered sublime tints of orange sherbet, blurple, and pistachio green hues splattered subtly on faces, shiny black vinyl shadows, stainless steel, is astounding.

Skittles meets lava lights meets noire.

An impressive concert of staging, breath taking moods and vistas.

Setting is lush, costumes are tailored, both essential in defining attitude and depth and logic to a warriors demeanor.

Everything including chaos has its place and purpose and is unapologetically perfect how it lands. Heads or tails. Death or life.

All your past characters are here with some new faces that are sleek and streamline. Brooding, calculating, and committed.

For those who are seeing this with no backstory, you won't feel disappointed or out of the loop. The film is excellent exciting and action is everything.

Keanu Reeves is enjoyable as well as the cast.

I will say the opening scenes were shocking.

Dont miss, there is another scene after all the closing credits.

The best part of this film is they took time to give a cut that tells and fleshes out an appealing story. It's fun and easy to watch. So go and enjoy.",9
menashek-83305,"10/10 best movie of the year I will definitely rewatch it on the weekend highly recommend Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.",10
ejt-53207,"Best in the series in my opinion. I went into this expecting it to be mediocre. I didn't think the first three were THAT great.. over hyped imo due to the internet crush on nice guy Keanu.

But.. The action in this is by far the best; most intense and realistic (whatever that means in the wickiverse) in the series, with the least amount of noticeable ""dumb bad guy"" flubs. It also has some of the coolest cinematography I've seen in any action film. Kudos for being able to make a killer third sequel, progressively getting better in regards to general film making, while reusing the same general plot- something not even lethal weapon could pull off. The acting is still pretty bad, though I doubt anyone watches John Wick for the acting. This one won me over to the franchise.",8
fmhazel-43721,"Ok, real talk. Some of the situations John Wick went through, seemed I unrealistic - agreed. However, this movie had me at the edge of my seat the entire time. Charon dying - what? What! And then every second of the movie, while cheering on John Wick, was amazing. Then, with Lawrence Fishbourne, towards the end, ""your wearing a suit to either you wedding or funeral""... and then John (Keanu) stating what he wants on his tombstone... are you kidding me? Also, yes, should he died other times, yes; however, cevlar suits. So he is protected either way just bc of his suit. Then he went to the church and told Cain, it doesn't have to end with either of us dying, then the ending happened - pefcection. The move was phenomenally done. The ending was perfect. Every time I think the next John Wick movie was better (ie: parabellum) being the best, you came out with this and I was beyond thrilled, impressed and happy. The perfect ending to an amazing franchise.",10

pasmwut,"I'm very confused by the ratings for this movie. It was super fun and had some really cool world building but John Wick getting hit by 100 cars and bouncing up, using his jacket like it's Vibranium, and effortless shooting through the full armor of villains was fun but absurd. The gun trick at the end was really obvious, like how would that person not realize John didn't fire? The sound editing and the angle of the camera make it very easy to see all this. I do not get why this is getting rated higher than other Wick movies. One was small budget and really clever and tight, and 2 was bigger and more action but still realistic. 3 gets a little more absurd but by the stair scene in the 4th movie it's like a DC movie because it's too dark for marvel.",7
singeramju,"As a Hollywood action movie junkie, I was thrilled to catch the latest installment in the John Wick franchise, Chapter 4. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint.

Keanu Reeves once again delivers a jaw-dropping performance as the titular character, John Wick. The film picks up right where Chapter 3 left off, with John on the run from the High Table after breaking the rules of the assassin's world.

The action sequences in Chapter 4 are simply incredible. From hand-to-hand combat to gun fights, the choreography is top-notch and will leave you on the edge of your seat. And the fact that Reeves does most of his own stunts only adds to the realism and intensity of the fight scenes.

But it's not just the action that makes this movie great. The story is also compelling, with John seeking revenge against those who have wronged him while also trying to navigate the complex world of assassins and their rules.

The supporting cast also shines in Chapter 4, with standout performances from Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, and newcomer Donnie Yen. And of course, the dogs make a welcome return and are just as badass as ever.

Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a must-see for fans of the franchise and action movie lovers in general. It's a thrilling ride from start to finish and leaves you eagerly anticipating the next installment.",9
dimzilemenos,"Watched the movie and i truly enjoyed it. John Wick chapter 4 is a perfect sequel and on the whole a perfect action movie. Firstly i should mention the incredible fight scenes where choreography,camera movement and placement ,colours, landscapes and music contribute to make them unique and intersting. Of course that is the reason the first three movies had succes and thus this one succesfully succeeds them. The style and tone that is created via lighting,scenery,colour,music and acting is unique and aesthetically beautifull. The action varies,being rarely repetitive and it is easy to follow the plot ,(wich is an excuse so the action scenes could happen).

On the other hand the movie ,(as expected from a john wick sequel ),is filled with violence and deaths as john wick proceeds to murder half the population of Paris and every assassin that comes after him. As i said it is a John Wick movie.

On the whole for its genre JohnWick chapter 4 is a masterpiece.",6

kelseyswarthout,"I don't even know where to begin. So much of this movie is done to perfection. To start the locations they picked for this one are absolutely gorgeous. So many unique buildings and history spots that they capture beautifully. The fight choreography blends perfectly with them and they play really well off of eachother. So much variety with weapon types and fighting styles in the scenes with some new stuff that I hadn't seen in the previous films.

And the music!! Goes so well with the action and in particular I loved the scenes where the music is paired with the radio. A lot of amazing camera work. Specifically the overhead one shot take of one of the fight scenes. Wow. I would see the movie again just for that scene. Would love to see some behind the scenes of it. All of the new characters were great additions too.

My only critique is one of the beginning fight scenes felt a little too similar to a museum fight scene in one of the other films. But overall absolutely loved this movie. It was long but felt necessary and never lost my interest.",10
desanmol,"Best Action Scenes in the past years and one of the most impresive choreography and storyline is predictive but surprises at some point. Franchise have been built bigger and Characters in the movie are very good. A new approach has been done by director by giving this movie a new perspective and Cinematography is better than all the previous movies, VFX work is very good but can be easily noticed in some scenes. Movie does not feel like stretched and Comedy is added in this part which i liked, All Credit goes to stuntman, Director and New Music is very great. Background Score is also very good.",8
vizkesh,"In The John wick films they've created this magical mysterious world, and so many wonderful characters, where the sub players themselves are fascinating enough to be the subject of their own movie. Part four hit the pinnacle in this area with about 3 different spin offs that would intrigue. I personally thought the sub character, Caine was immense and one should not ignore some fine acting and a distinguished cast.

There has been no expense spared in chapter four, from cast to settings/locations, great action sequences which are incredibly technical. This film has been extremely well made from start to end, in every department.

There will be haters, this is not meant to be an Ingmar Bergman. Love it for what it is.

Only Keannu got could play John wick.",9
kharazmihossein,In my opinion john wick is one of the best movie in the history of international cinema because it's secens are very natural and very near to real life but in chapter4 some secens were imaginary and did't like chepter2 and1 nut totally was be great with great actors and screenplay i so enjoyed and it's my favorite movie john wick had the great ending and i very surprised the actors were great and they played very well i don't know how discribe this great movie i can't use the condign words to discribe that i just can say it was fantasic and indelible the international cinema is proud to having this great movie.,10
georgialin,"Cool movie but I feel bad for those who died. John Wick has killed so many and witnessed the death of his wife. So why not just save the pain for many other families. Especially for his Japanese friend, he died because he wanted to protect John Wick. People either got killed by him or died because of helping him. And the girl, who had absolutely wanted not to be part of it, lost her dad, her family business, and got shot. How brutal it was. I like the girl because someone at least spoke up to John, told him that all the sacrifices were not necessary. But John Wick seemed to think the different way: everyone can die because I want to live. I understand this is an action film, and a John Wick film, so anything that is not fighting has lower priority. But still, not every one signed up for this.",5
kkorsman,This movie was amazing. It had good story. Very good characters. And the character development was amazing. It was visually stunning. Just amazing. The new characters that they introduced were amazing. Im not gonna spoil anything but i will see what i mean after watching the film. Chad stahelski did a great job with this movie. He knew exactly what to do with this movie. He knew what to do with John wicks character. And he did it perfectly. This movie isnt just about killing. This movie has a amazing story. The other john wick movies had a pretty good story too. But chapter 4 had the best story in the whole franchise. Easy 9/10 for me.,9
esulk-63906,"The best action movie I have ever seen in my life I recommend it for all the action scenes, the sound effects and especially the cinematic effects of movement around the shot excellent üëå with the lighting effects of the locations it was crazy.the best of the franchise, the length is about 3 hours, it doesn't feel heavy, it's the best, the scenes in Tokyo are very enjoyable, the new weapons, WOW very cool, great that they include new martial arts actors, it was super to see them fight, the change of focus that the character suffers is incredible, the action exceeded my expectations, you really have to see it. This movie is a work of art.",10
evancartin,"I just enjoyed John Wick 4 and have to say that the mix of art and action in this movie is just amazing! The fight is presented like a ballet, with smooth movements and highly skilled coordination. This film is absolutely spectacular, and I fell in love with every action that was put into it. The story is simple, but managed to captivate my attention, even though the Marquis character is a bit underdeveloped. But who can deny the greatness of Keanu Reeves as John Wick? She really is stunning! Even though the story is not very strong, the action shown still manages to make up for these weaknesses. However, I feel disappointed with some of the characters who are not so alive, especially vallian, but are still disguised again with the irony that John Wick has to pay for his actions. Overall though, John Wick 4 is a must-see, especially for fans of quirky and skillful action.",9
ryderrickey,"I watched this with a group of friends and it made the experience that much better. The movie had great action sequences amazing new characters, and a pretty nice villian. The plot was decent it could have been better and more fitting. Even though this isn't the best John Wick Movie, its still reslly good and I defenitley recommend watching this. The movie did have a good balance of humour, action, and sadness. Mr. Nobody was an amazing character I am begging for a spin off. The only actual downsides are the length because at some points it feels alittle dragged out in some action sequences but oversll great movie üëç.",8
glebst,"On March 23, the Russian box office released the film directed by Chad Stahelski ""John Wick 4"", a sequel about the hired killer John Wick, who is trying to find peace in the underworld. And I, being a fan of this universe, went to the cinema and watched it on the first day of rental and I want to tell you about my impressions.

So, the film tells about another confrontation between John and his new enemies: an old friend of Kane (Donnie Yen), one of the high-ranking members of the Marquis de Gramont's High Table (Bill Skarsgard) and an unnamed mercenary with a dog. John has found a way to defeat the Clan Board and wants to end this confrontation forever, but the Clan Board and the mercenaries continue to hunt for him. Marquis has received an unlimited amount of resources to destroy the ""Boogeyman"" and is trying to kill him with all his might, sparing no one in his path.

I must say right away, I really liked the movie. Chad Stahelski managed to maintain a special atmosphere, such as the first three films, and at the same time increased the timing of the fourth part, compared to the others.

Despite this length of the film, it is interesting to watch. It is filled with interesting, colorful, breath-taking moments. It is immediately clear that a piece of the soul has been invested in the production.

The whole team has done a huge and painstaking job. A variety of locations (France, Germany, Japan), a lot of well-shot and spectacularly shown action scenes, excellent musical accompaniment and excellent acting.

As a result, I really liked the film, I would even call this part the best. I would recommend this movie to watch only if you know the plot of the previous films.

I give this movie 8 out of 10.",8
leenetsalah,"I've never written a review on IMDB. I created an account solely with the intent to leave a review on this movie.

If you haven't watched any John Wick movies, it's one of the few movie franchises that don't juice all their ideas in one movie, create a hit, then release a sequel just to continue gaining revenue. Rather, the director proceeds to ideate in order to create a compelling story that harmonises with the previous movie.

The first three movies are great. But the fourth one is just out of the park. It's incomparable to the others, in terms of ideation, setting, cinematography, and performance. Simply phenomenal.

They say Keanu Reeves only said 380 words in the movie, but you wouldn't notice due to how compelling the story really is.

This movie thrives off of the action scenes; however, there are a handful of well-acted non action scenes.

John Wick 4 has truly set the bar for action movies in 2023. I'd even go as far as saying action movies in general.

Definitely recommend!",10
psychedelia-53851,"I was really looking forward to this final installment of the the Keanu Reeves titular character as I loved the previous 3 in the series and up until the film went rip-off the rails I was suspending the superhuman resilience of Johnny Wick himself. But when they brought in a dj towards the latter part of the film the film lost my support. The reason for this is that it is a direct rip-off of the Warriors, one of my favorite films. From the dialogue to the use of Nowhere to Run, it was the director's insert that, excuse the expression, proverbially killed the movie for me. I read after seeing the movie that the director wanted to homage the film but this extraneous garbage was so cringe for me. Maybe a lot of people who never saw the Warriors won't care, but for me, it displayed a useless insert. It was almost word for word plagiarism. It took me out of the film until the final scene when I was sort of able to finish the film with some assemblage of enjoyment. Sad how certain things can ruin a good thing. Oh, and the tag after the credits was so predictable, especially since word got out that certain surviving characters were spinning off into their own films, etc. If that dj scene weren't in the film, I'd be giving it a higher rating.",5
babatundetola,"It's literally being in love mainly or only with the action. The story, caring about the characters, and the plot are just stupid. If a movie in the future delivers a much better action than this movie, we would all just move on to that.

There's a reason why Luke Skywalker till this day is among the most iconic fictional characters of all time. Which is the bond between the characters and the audience. That real connection of being inspired and that we care about the character. Thus, we won't ever move on from such connection. As for future great characters, we'll simply make room for them and NOT replace the old.

That's what's missing from John Wick 4, even though the action and the production were all amazing.",5
negisushant,"‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® Where do I even begin, this movie is an absolute masterpiece. Chapter 4 took this series to levels I did not even think were possible, the last 3 entries in the series were absolutely amazing and were near perfection but chapter 4 is the best by a mile. From Director Chad Stahelski comes the 4th installment of the long running franchisee which is not showing any sign of slowing down. It's like drinking old wine which just tastes better with age and such is the case with John wick series so far, the current one better than the last one.

Well this time stakes are all time high with the High table hell bent on finishing John wick off once and for all by any means Necessary. But the thing is this time our Protagonist is not being hunted like his last outing but is hunting his way up the table in his pursuit for freedom and getting closure on his wife.

This installment has doubled down on everything be it headcounts, length of the action sequences to the gorgeous Cinematography. The use of different light settings in different world zones of Osaka, Paris, Berling or Newyork is a sight to behold which just ups the ante in every possible way. The use of BGM when any action sequence kicks off simply ignites the adrenaline rush until it keeps you wanting for more in a breathtaking style.",10
jbgonlinebiz,"John Wick Chapter 4 is a movie that delivers on every front, from the stunning visuals to the flawless execution of fight scenes. This latest installment in the John Wick franchise continues the trend of delivering action-packed sequences that leave audiences on the edge of their seats.

One of the standout features of John Wick Chapter 4 is the incredible stunts and choreography. The fight scenes are some of the most intricate and well-executed I have ever seen on the big screen. The movements are fluid and seamless, with each strike and block perfectly timed and executed. It is clear that a lot of thought and planning went into creating these sequences, and the result is truly breathtaking.

The use of technology in creating these stunts is also impressive. The movie uses state-of-the-art tools and techniques to create a world that feels real and immersive. From the sound design to the special effects, every element of the movie has been carefully crafted to create an experience that is both thrilling and believable.

The performances of the actors in John Wick Chapter 4 are also noteworthy. Keanu Reeves continues to impress in his role as John Wick, bringing a depth and complexity to the character that is rare in action movies. The supporting cast also delivers strong performances, adding depth and nuance to the story.

Overall, I give John Wick Chapter 4 a well-deserved five stars. This movie is a masterclass in action filmmaking, delivering stunning stunts and choreography that are a joy to watch. The use of technology and the performances of the actors only add to the overall experience, making this movie a must-see for fans of the genre.

If you're a fan of the John Wick franchise, or simply a lover of action movies, then this latest installment is not to be missed. From the first frame to the final credits, John Wick Chapter 4 is a thrilling and immersive experience that will leave you wanting more.",10
zelopes,"Well, I have learned many many interesting things:

1. France really got rid of hundreds (thousands?) of evil-doers in this movie.

2. Police in France are literaly non existent.

3. Music in french discotheques is apparently so loud that it's getting people completely deaf ... It was really hard to get them to run from that crazy shooting. (edit) wait... maybe they were robots from Tesla?

4. Dead people disappear just like in a common FPS game... or maybe french undertakers are extremely effective. Or... they really were reaspawning.

5. I'm going to organize my son's next anniversary party in Paris, in one of those monument sites. I got to the conclusion that not a single site manager or security warden will bother us about installing our inflatable castle. I will only have to worry about using the right power outlet adaptor and we're set!

While the film undeniably delivers on its promise of adrenaline-fueled entertainment, it also veers into the realm of the fantastical, blurring the line between thrilling realism and implausible fiction.",5
darrel-10269,"The movie meet all the standard for the entire series of John wick...

The movie is definitely loaded with a lot of action and well casted actors who has played a terrific role .... Showing love and caring for a dog is really loving and good nature in the entire movie.

The lenght of the movie seems to be stretched out as compared to John Wick 1,2 and 3.

Truely entertainment with loaded action. It would be more better if the character John wick had little more dialogues as compared to the other cast. Excellent sound effects too for the entire movie which made it really special.

Hats off to the team and all the crew members.",8
jonashtune,"...or is it?

The wife and I went home after watching this on opening night and immediately queued up the first John Wick that kicked everything off. I remarked after the scene when his puppy is killed in that first film ""and this is what started a nonstop body count that ended up somewhere over 1,000 and spanned four films!!"" I think this supplanted the Bond franchise in terms of being more in touch with the kind of 21st century post-Tarantino violence film goers have come to expect from our favorite assassin with a very big chip on his shoulder.

Such a shame to have lost Lance Reddick. Just glad we got to see him on the screen one final time. He and Ian McShane embodied The Continental and brought it to life.

We never once grew bored or weary during the nearly 3-hour runtime. As with each prior film, the action only grew more frenetic and continued unabated from the opening scene. Bill Skarsgard has obviously cornered the market playing creepy baddies, and his Marquis was wonderfully understated yet menacing. Hiroyuki Sanada, Shamier Anderson, Clancy Brown (THE KERGAN!), and Donnie Yen all delivered in their respective roles as erstwhile allies or opponents. We can only hope that there is still more to John Wick and his story!",9
jkhoylman,"Quick paced, almost to an excess, John Wick: Chapter 4 never ceases to entertain. The franchise has spent three feature-length films up to this point reaching the precipice of being so ridiculous as to be indistinguishable from surrealism. This was, of course, inevitable as soon as sequels started getting churned out. There's no realistic way to bump up the action, since you started the first one at 100%. You can't fake the tension here. Once you throw a certain challenge at the protagonist, the audience knows they'd almost certainly win under any similar circumstances, because they won mostly by skill and relied little on luck to succeed. So the only way to create new tension is to throw more guys at him, give the bad guys bigger (read: better) weapons, or put him at a worse disadvantage. What makes 4 so enjoyable is that every so often it will take a second to acknowledge that in films that followed the franchise's beginning as a pseudo-parody of gritty, ""realistic"" action thrillers, which tried to show us that battles between groups of professional assassins would be ruthlessly efficient and well executed, rather than over the top and macho, they have themselves become worthy of parody, and delights in it.

""Oh so John can just challenge a High Table member to a duel and then he will be able to be free of The Table? And we can use it to fix all of his, and Winston, and Caine's problems?""

""Yeah but first John needs to get back into his family (see John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum) so that he can challenge the dude to a duel legitimately. So now he's got to go to Berlin and kill people""

""Alright, let's go kill people""

A blind, retired, Wick-level assassin that's an old friend of Wick's and is also coerced into killing Wick (read: special people)? Hell yes! A Mexican standoff that is resolved by a hand of poker, which is itself of no importance other than to show off character personalities and deliver dramatic and thematic monologues (the situation was actually resolved, of course, by killing people)? Hell yes! There is even a top-down sequence with fire-bullets which makes it feel even more like a video game. And every time there's this little moment where they almost say ""hey watch what we're about to pull"" to let you know they're in on it. They want you to laugh at it.

Lots of killing people, loved it.",8
midas-63171,"Whether you will watch it for the fantastic action sequences or you will be watching it for the story. Either way, it will not disappoint. It has some of the best action sequences I've seen in the series and in movies in general. Not only is the action great - the visuals and cinematography was also great. Seriously, some shots from this movie are supposed to be in my laptop's lock screen. Not only is the action and visuals great, but the pacing is never too slow or too fast, it's usually at the perfect pace for a movie that's two and a half hours long. The movies puts a beautiful, yet sad end to the protagonist's character arc and to the series. This also gives us the possibility of other spin-offs. Or a perhaps a prequel...",8
slotpulsa2023,"Ohn Wick 4 is an action-packed thrill ride that delivers on all fronts. Keanu Reeves once again shines in his iconic role as John Wick, and the stunts and fight scenes are more intense and jaw-dropping than ever before. The film's storyline is engaging, and the pacing is spot on, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish.

One of the things that sets John Wick 4 apart from its predecessors is its deeper exploration of the character's backstory and motivations. While the film still has plenty of high-octane action, it also delves into the emotional and psychological aspects of John Wick's life, making him a more fully realized and relatable character.

Overall, John Wick 4 is a must-see for action fans and anyone who enjoys a well-crafted, thrilling movie. With its expertly choreographed fight scenes, strong performances, and gripping storyline, this film is a testament to the power of the action genre when executed with care and skill.",10
cameronlaster,"Let me start off by saying I love this series, so it pains me to have to say that this is the worst entry in the series.

Is the movie bad? No, it'll keep you entertained for the most part.

The set pieces are beautiful as to be expected and the plot is ok.

Then what's the problem?

This movie has 2 big problems... The new characters and the action sequences.

Donnie Yens role (Caine) is literally a video game character (Blind Kenshi)! He felt out of place in this film.

Then there is the black guy who is a military cowboy...? I mean OK I guess but he added nothing to this film.

Now we get to the action scenes which in my opinion is the movies biggest flaw.

There was a flow to the action scenes in the previous 3 films but not here. In this movie the gunplay feels wasted because every character is wearing armor or some bulletproof suit, which means that everybody using a gun has to use it the exact same way...all head shots with no variation.

Ok but guys can still fight right?

No...not really most of the hand to hand combat is broken up by you guessed it more gunplay.

There is a part early on in the film where John is fighting with nunchaku and my man clearly don't know how to use them. He just looks sluggish in every scene.

In closing the movie ain't terrible but it's not a masterpiece either. I still love the series but I can see this turning into the fast and the furious if it continues.",6
ahmetberkayyilmaz,"Action scenes were pretty cool. The car scene which is in the middle of the city, was one of the most beautiful part of the movie. In some parts the movie touched on deep topics with little details. Like we haven't seen the council members during the whole series. Council represents the richest people in the world beyond who we know and people work for them(like Marchese de Grant) are the ones that we know as the richest ones. As we see in the dico scene society is not aware of what is actually happening. As a big fan of John Wick movie, chapter 4(I guess the last chapter) was the most exciting one. Also, I don't think it could end in a better way than this it was enough satisfying.",9
1xbet-iran,"When you were inside the Matrix, you remember having extraordinary combat abilities. However, when you were in the world of humans, or the Zion, you were just an ordinary human. These abilities were specific to the world of The Matrix, just like a series of events specific to the world of John Wick. There are indeed bullets that can be fired, and there are bulletproof clothing, a simple search can confirm these claims. So, all of these are specific to the fictional world. For instance, another characteristic of this world is the absence or minimal intervention of the police, which hopefully will be explained in later parts. Just like the reason for not getting hurt in the fictional world was explained to be due to the clothing. So, let's first understand the fictional world and then form an opinion. By the way, I didn't like the TV series ""Stargate"" because it lacked action and dragons. What do you think?",9

If you've seen any of the the first three John Wick movies, you know they are action filled.....But get ready for a new standard in packing action into a movie. New guns, new twists, so much excitement. It is a long movie, but if you like tons of fighting and action it keeps you wanting more. It's definitely a popcorn flick, but so good and entertaining. Unlike the last three Wick movies, Chapter 4 had the audience laughing out loud at several scenes. Without being a spoiler, I'll just say there are a few really funny things that happen. We absolutely loved it and can't wait for Chapter 5. Keanu is great!!",8

John Wicks death was unexpected and I don't really think he died. Even though the movie was long, it didn't feel empty. Always something going on. Also loved the characters. Bill Skarsg√•rd portraid his character perfectly. A little dissapointed that concierge didn't get much screen time. ( Rest in peace Lance Reddick ).

Be prepared for some of the greatest action and fight scenes mixed with some terrific acoustics . The visuals and the overall mood of every scene keep you on edge. We couldn't even tell when the 3 hours have passed unlike almost every poorly scripted action film they we see nowadays, you just can't wait to see what happens next.

The director of photography and cinematography did a exceptional job the theme of this movie was very good every scene was complimenting one another every shot flowed fluidly.

I highly recommend to watch this movie in IMAX you'll get a better experience than going to a regular theater. I didn't see the credit cookie everyone is raving about seem like there will be a spin-off if so John Wick trilogies will live on for years to come. Will be looking forward to that.,9
lolpzaz,"In its simplest form, the fourth installment of the John Wick series is an entertaining and action-packed movie, although some may argue it's overly action-packed.

However, let's get to the point. I purchased a ticket with the expectation of one thing, and that expectation was not only met but exceeded. From beginning to end, the movie kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth mentioning the undeniable presence of over-the-top action sequences, where John Wick effortlessly becomes an invincible killing machine with impeccable aim and no concern for fall damage. If this were a game and we were playing as John Wick, it would undoubtedly be an exhilarating experience to annihilate enemies non-stop for two hours.

But let's not forget, this is precisely what I signed up for. I came to the movie anticipating a high-octane action extravaganza, and that's exactly what I got. Admittedly, the story took a backseat, but to be honest, I didn't expect a complex narrative in the first place.

What truly impressed me was the sheer creativity displayed in the cinematography. Each scene was meticulously crafted, showcasing top-tier action film production values that not only justified the budget but surpassed expectations.

In terms of concluding the series, John Wick Chapter 4 provides a satisfactory ending, although the story itself may not be compelling enough to explore further beyond the action presented to us.

However, I must emphasize that if you approach the film with conventional movie standards, expecting more than just action, you may find it lacking or even dull.

In summary, this movie is perfect for those seeking an adrenaline-fueled blockbuster solely focused on action. On the other hand, if you're looking for rich storytelling and well-developed characters, it's best to steer clear.

P. S: The character of John Wick was brilliantly established in the first movie, offering us glimpses into his backstory. The subsequent films primarily emphasize the character's action-oriented side.",8
arnoldspokas,"When I went to watch this movie at the theaters, the first half of the film I felt like I threw away my money, however this quickly changed after I understood why I'm really here.

If you are the one who hasn't seen any of the movies in the franchise, don't expect much. In fact, my friend who hasn't seem any of the movies fell asleep half way.

The friend who has seen a few, said the only thing he liked is the filmography.

Me, on the other hand, during the second part of the movie, understood that I came to watch a movie whose main goal is to blow you away with its incredible fight scenes and effects. And that it does. Don't expect much storytelling or really any story at all, because after watching the movie, it felt like I just watched the 3 series of the franchise again, however with the great action that a Wick movie has to offer.

In all, if you are a hard John Wick fan, you'll be happy with probably the best Wick movie in the franchise, however if you are looking for an interesting script, which will get you close to your screen, don't.

Good film. The above scene is crazy. 8/10.",8
winsonchow,Love it love it love it!! Awesome fights scenes and very creative and hilarious in the middle of it.

fahadkhanraj11,"John Wick is my most favorite action movie series. The first three movies were among my most favorites in this genre. But unfortunately, the fourth one is hard to correlated with the previous ones. It resembled more a fantasy movie. I have some queries that are bothering me.

1) How can a blind guy shoot so precisely and never miss anyone? How can he track and shoot a stationary target? Was a blind character really necessary for a role of something that requires eyes the most?

2) How does John Wick never get exhausted? He keeps falling from high buildings. He keeps getting beaten by big guys. He gets hit by cars several times. Yet, he comes out fresh.

3) Why does everyone aspire to help him. Even if it means risking their own lives? Even the girl whose father died because of John Wick helps him.

4) Why does John never apologize to anyone? He caused the death of many of his friends. Yet, he never regrets.

5) What happened to the characters that survived the previous prequels? What about the two Asian twin fighters from John Wick 3 that John let live? What about Vigo's brother? Where is the Adjudicator whom John should've sought revenge for? Where is Sofia? What about Aurelio?

In spite of these flaws, I have to admit that the cinematography, action and entertainment were amazing. It was beyond my expectations. The environment, camera work and cinematography were stunning and eye catching. This movie is perhaps unbeatable in terms of action compared to any other movie.",6
kenkimathi-02121,"Where do I start? Let me just say how you do anything is how you do everything and mr john wick gets things done. Great acting, amazing action scenes. Hell breaks loose and and breathtaking watching it unfold. Uts becomes one of the very few sequels i would recommend for any fan of action movies. The storyline maybe a little shaky in my opinion but it does manage to get someone to the end without being too predictable and simple. Great movie, would even go right ahead and say one of the best movies this year. All in all i'd have given it a solid ten if not for the somehow shaky storyline but i am more than pleased.",9
smbt-62520,"I love the John Wick series, and this seems a fitting end if indeed it is the end.

The fight scenes are some of the best ever on film, and the new characters introduced in chapter 4 were great!

If you stuck around for the scene at the end of the credits you saw how they left it open for a possible 5,(not everything is as it seems perhaps?!)

Don't really have anything to criticize with this one, it was pretty awesome.

Now, I'm assuming this review will actually get posted because I did not say anything negative that'll offend a certain political party, so enjoy everyone, cheers!

A+++++++++++",9
angelaurquiza,"Ok this movie is exactly what you expect John wick been good at what he does. I don't want to go in detail because of spoilers but I'll try the best I can one of the main characters at the beginning a character that we all love found his fate can't help but making you awwww. The culture of one the friends of wick is pretty cool. Parts of Germany, France, and New York great scenes and the fights. Spoiler alert there a lot of gun shots. Lol the bad guy kinda of annoying and such a cliche. But guess kinda work. My only issue was the annoying black dj girl trying so hard to sound cool. Sorry. But the warriors made it cool this was just a wannabe. And the end it was so cool wait until the end of the credits.",9
heydarniyam,"JW 4 has the potential to be the best of the franchise yet made. The screenwriting is more coherent and adequate. It introduces great new characters that could be developed more profoundly and discovered thoroughly. They have maintained the legacy of JW and its brutal nature meanwhile adding new notions like brotherhood, fatherhood and father-daughter relationship. Cinematography and fight choreography are perfect ; capturing dim theme of JW and its true nature. Caine and Mr. Nobody are fantastic characters that need further attention. For instance, as a fan, I'm eager to know more about his background and how he became blind. I also like to know more about Mr. Nobody's background and his ability to be a great stalker( in a way). I enjoyed Scott Adkins portrayal in the movie. He was well processed and his character is really gruesome. With all that being said, I think this one is by far the best one and if they end it here (which I don't think that would be the case), it'll be a great farewell to John Wick's world.",10
reginaldx,"This newest chapter is honestly just as good, if not better, than the first one. I was a little concerned since the two previous ones only got crazier and crazier, trying to one up each other. But this one's story, plot, set pieces, and action is actually the best we've seen from the franchise so far. The casting was perfect, all the actors did a phenomenal job and I can't forget about Lance Reddick. It was a little sad knowing what happened to him in real life but, as always, his actual performance in the movie was amazing. I'd strongly recommend this to any fan of this series. You won't be disappointed.",9
ksethi-30375,"Great action sequences, next level camera work. You can't take your eyes off. These things only can experienced in big screen.

Color grading is excellent. The light work between the action sequence is phenomenal.

After interval there is only actions sequences and those are GREAT. Everyone did a great job.

Runtime is little long, but your can't get bored.

It has every possible action scenes. Horse , Car, Bike , Pencil amd more.

Words can not explain the whole experience.

John wick 4 has set new bar for upcoming action movies.

Please go and experience this masterpiece by yourself. U won't go wrong.

Thank You.",10
furlongdelfin,"John Wick 4 follows it's predecessor action scenes and evens tops with one of the final scenes. Still the movie feels bland in my opinion. Action scenes keep getting overly complex and you start disbelieving them due to their complexity. Chapter one worked because the action was (with some suspended disbelief) believable. As the saga continued we get a Fast & Furious problem where it just doesn't make any sense story wise or action wise.

Yes the action is well shot, the cinematic is incredible, but just no believable anymore. The movie fails in that respect.

Also the movie inside world of the High Table seems even more far off than before. Yes the High Table wants to kill John Wick. Now who is the high table? What do they want?

Control/money/power? All 3?

I would have enjoyed seeing the high table politics in action, seeing the network of high profile politicians under their wing working and making plans. Just Kill John wick is a lame motivation.

Also the Movie is way to long for the average consumer. Studios are trying to figure out why people don't go to the movies anymore? They make their movies almost 3 hours long and fill them with pointless scenes.

Still I enjoyed my cinema experience but I would have enjoyed it more if they made their movie more down to earth and shorter. Also if they showed more of the high table instead of 40 action scenes that are all mostly the same concept.",6
mikefooyc,"Watched all 3 John Wick and was excited about the 4th installment. My apologies if my slightly low rating offends some people. I'll keep spoilers to a minimum.

The movie starts and picks up immediately from where it left off from the previous movie wasting zero time. Fast paced action like the previous installments. The visuals are good with a lot of scenes being very colorful despite most of the fight scenes takes place at night. Fight arenas where huge fights break out are visually stunning just like the previous installment.

Sound composer is superb with subtle heart rhythm in certain scenes, although not Christopher Nolan level but certainly very interesting use of sound effects.

Vast array of weapons used and some interactions conducted in the local language which is what the real world is like. You don't go to some foreign country expecting their people especially big time crime lords to speak English all the time. I also see someone took inspiration from Jackie Chan stunt technique to make some fight scene looks serious and comical at the same time.

At the end of the movie, it's a huge relief seeing the burden being lifted of John Wicks, the man himself Keanu Reeves and the moviegoers whom have been diligently following through a 4 movies.

The cons and spoilers Character development seems to have taken back seat compared to previous movies. The movie also looks rushed as some sharp eye audiences will notice.

The plot might be linear and fast paced just like the Fast Furious series but the main difference being, if someone is watching JW4 for the first time with no background knowledge is going to be left with a lot of questions.

Wouldn't it be much more engaging if Winston was killed instead of his concierge? Then his concierge being the loyal servant works with other concierge members around the world to help JW avenge Winston's killer. First time watchers would be pleased too.

And JW this time seems to have his entire magical 3 piece suit made out of vibranium. Sustaining little injuries despite having platoons of men and women unloading obscene amounts of rounds at one man. Perhaps they all graduated from stormtrooper school.

The previous movies sees JW taking hits, seeking medical care and more character development where the audience feels more for him. David vs Goliath moment. His death scene almost looks too good, did they hire a coroner for his make up? The blood patches look too dry like its painted on. Ironman's death looks spot on as completely devastated shock, awe and peace at the same time.

Action scene in Japan seems to have the stuntman ninjas frozen in literal fear for his life. They just stood there shaking in fear waiting for JW to mercifully dispatch them. Then seem all fine and dandy taking shots from a machine gun but one throw from JW against the wall, they stand shaking in fear.

Waterfall that works in mysterious ways, haven't figured out how the waterfall club works as he fight completely drenched but walks down the stairs little water dripping off him.

It's a relief to see the man and the legend can finally closed off the original franchise for good.",7
uno-84968,"John Wick 4 improves on its predecessor which was arguably too goofy and over the top, replacing it with more believable lore and mythology, being the best of the sequels to the original.

Excellent casting with experienced action stars , great action although John Wick is immune to car hits and falling from windows, still pack a punch, and a better more realistic story makes Chapter 4 quite good.

John wick dying was a poetic end to his character and doing another sequel would need something truly special to avoid feeling uncessary It is filled with violence, including an amazing dragon breath shotgun and some video game sequel shots.

Character work is much improved, with depth and personality being given to assassins rather than only fight Wick.

Overall, an explosive and mostly satisfying finale .",8
mayb-91559,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is filled with more action, fight scenes with even longer and more detailed choreography plus it's so insanely explosive that at this point there are definitely scenes that are getting very questionable in logic, but that's ultimately of little importance. Something unique and exceptional in this saga is the elegant violence of each scene and a well-handled villain. The movie was firing on all cylinders for (what might be) the final chapter and, in conclusion, I can happily say that the John Wick series is one of the best actions film series in decades. I'm so glad spin-offs are coming.",9
mandylane-69001,"This is my second time going to the cinema this year.

So, lets start by telling you i am a disabled person, neverminded here is what i thought about the movie.

The intro story was a bit confusing to me. The location of the rich and well decorated hotel was interesting.

The characters were interesting but felt like some of them was not bad-ass enough.

What made the movie lets say boring was the fact that it was mostly at night time and now let me say the colors in the movie was over saturated. It felt like there was too much colors in the scenes.

John Wick has aged a bit and that was Okay.

It felt like it was some kind of funny fights rather than serious. Wick had so much energy and endurance during the fights it came to a point you can think unrealistic. The locations of the world Paris was interesting but i think movie could been filmed more at day time and less at night. Tokyo or whatever the city was was okay for the scenes.

The audio was good nothing wrong here. The effects, and sound effects was well done.

My complaint is as i never had the chance to see the ending is that during these two hours i could watch in the cinema the story was..um.. lacking a lot!

It was quite nice to see Keanu Reeves on screen though.

The fighting scenes was brutal and wick basically executed his enemies one after another in line.

I don't know... the movie would had bigger potential with a stronger story and different world locations.

I honestly think the previous movies were higher standards. Maybe John Wick needs to try again.",7
anuragsinghkota,"The movie is very good. It contains all the elements of a action movie. It tells about the basic principles of friendship and human nature of self respect. The main character of John wick played by Keanu Reeves is portrayed as good as possible. Donnie yen also gave his full potential for his role. The movie is good but some action scenes in starting are too long , action scenes are top level, the movie can be watched by anyone it is not at all r rated that much .The visuals are marvellous , and the dialogue are nicely delivered, The movie is good to watch . Must watch in theatres . Best movie of 2023.",9
wackguitar,"If countless sequences of a man's brains being shot out of his head is ""your thing"", you will be enraptured by this film. I could not give you a number for the number of vacated brains... Earlier editions of this franchise made much more effort at story and character development. Reeves actually had some emotionally charged scenes in some of them. Sadly, that does not happen this time around.

Scenes tumble onto the screen like a child's alphabet blocks striking a backlit carpet. We wait for images that add up to a stack of eloquent sentences but generally we receive ""F"" is for Friendship or ""G"" is for gun. And gun is very good. Guns seduce, they amuse, they dominate, they keep our ""hero"" alive. Uh-huh.

Look, I like a well done action movie. How many times will a speeding car slamming into Keanu's stunt double excite you? You're about to find out. Let's say it's 3 times for me. It starts to become silly. If a department store's worth of shattered glass, shell casings and old-fashioned weapons are what you call narrative, then rush out to the theater and then please do me a favor: translate that into an actual story for the rest of us... Performances in this bullet-fest are delivered with the sort of monotonous, stoic surety that makes Groot's lines from Guardians of the Galaxy, seem Shakespearean in scope and power. Bill Skarsgard's awkward turn as the fashion-conscious, French bad guy was sadly not even laugh-worthy, just embarrassing for all concerned. Shamier Anderson who plays ""The Tracker"" manages a magnetic, and warm performance in a role with very few lines. His negotiating tactics are crass but effective and one of the few plot successes in a film that echoes the genre of gun-slinging westerns but without the charm and careful pacing of the best examples.

JW4's musical soundtrack seems anxious to mimic the monotony of the ""manly"" dialogue. Grinding, thumping techno pop is the soupe du jour, soupe de semaine and the soupe du mois. Ouch! My head hurt after seeing this, literally. In fact when I got home, I put a mirror to the back of my head. Whew! Brain still appears to be properly housed. Thank you skull! No thank you John Wick 4.",N/A
mishuklucid,"Oh boy, where do I even start with John Wick 4? This movie was an absolute masterpiece. The filmmakers really outdid themselves with this one, and not in a good way. I mean I'm crazy about this franchise but this one left me disappointed.

First off, there was absolutely no flow to the movie. It was like the filmmakers just threw a bunch of random scenes together and called it a day. Two of my friends actually fell asleep during the movie. I mean, who needs heart-pumping, adrenaline-fueled fights when you can have characters just standing around and talking for no reason?

And speaking of boring content, there was plenty of that in this movie. And apparently I wasn't the only one suffering, because someone in the movie theater actually soiled themselves. Yep, you read that right. John Wick 4 was so bad that it caused bodily functions to malfunction.

All in all, I would say that John Wick 4 was the worst of the franchise. But hey, at least it had some redeeming qualities, like the fact that it was over and I could leave the theater. So if you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep or make you lose control of your bowels, then John Wick 4 is the perfect choice for you.",6
iluchacap,"First of all, The cinematography was fantastic and I was really fascinated by the sequences with that color combination and angles.

Regarding the soundtrack, I must say that it was unique because it was a flashback to the previous episodes and the exclusive music of this episode was extremely exciting.

Let me also say that the overall conclusion of the film, including the romantic, dramatic and violent action, was something special, and at the end, about John's death after his freedom . That was perfect.

I hope that john wick chapter 5 is gonna be perfect like this episode (flashback between chapter 3&4)",10
Goederaedt,"My take on John Wick Chapter 4: It lacked a compelling storyline, but compensated with visually stunning settings that transported me into a gritty underworld. However, there seemed to be an overindulgence in action sequences, showcasing masterful choreography that left me torn. On one hand, I appreciated the skill and precision involved, but on the other hand, it felt like an onslaught of relentless combat. Sometimes, too much of a good thing can be overwhelming, even if the quality remains exceptional. As they say, even an excess of something extraordinary can still be an excess.

Excessive.",6
Spoiledbrahmin,"All of the crooks that appeared in the film were real-life criminals and mafia members who were paid astronomical sums of money to appear in it. Bringing in the best of these guys isn't the easy part, KUDOS to the entire team.

Director Chad Stahelski did put every effort to bring in the best of Keanu and the case, Wick is Wicked and absolute fruckingly made action movie.

Stands out with the top list of action movies ever made, should be proud for the time the production team took and what they have delivered.

NO other best way to give farewell to Lance Reddick.

Best screenplay and it's the original content, waiting for the 4 hour long cut on the screens.",8
ewigergert,"The fighting is nice but it gets quite a repetitive in an almost l three hour movie.

The story is very weak, the whole killer guild thing is so made up. And where the hell. Is the police?

The dialogues are bad. It wouldn't make a difference if there is no conversation at all.

Also I didn't get the whole thing with the blind man and his daughter. Why did he sacrifice his eyes? What did he do wrong to put his daughter into trouble? What's the point of the man and his dog. He is quite unnecessary.

Shogare even fall into sleep in the last hour.

7 Stars because of the good fight with the fat guy in the club and because I like Keanu.",7

That's right exactly the same as the 2nd film, the blind assassin absolutely done to death but If you was a fan of film you would know this, I'm surprised they got the mouth breathers, netflix watching iPhone BMW uncultured masses to sit still for so long. The pure definition of deminishing resulta.",6
proulxalex,"Well... how to begin?

While the movie is super well made with plenty of fights and special effects... what I'm looking for in a movie (generally) is the suspension of disbelief, but you can forget about that for this movie... some scenes are so ludicrous and ridiculous they made me chuckle and I lost focus more than once.

I'm not sure if it was intended... but it felt more like a comedic action movie than an action movie like the 3 previous movies were. Some scene were cut and pieces of previous scene with a different angle or something... the movie felt like a parody of itself half way through... maybe it was intented that way? I was confused to say the least.

That being said I was greatly entertained, thus the 8 stars.",8
